Here were some of our engagements in H2 2021:</p><ul><li>We had the opportunity to participate in <a href=\"https://www.react-native.eu/\">React Native EU</a> with a talk from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshuaisgross\">Joshua Gross</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKOkILSLs0Q&t=3987s\">Bringing the Fabric renderer to the \u201CFacebook\u201D app</a></li><li>We hosted an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/pzdo1r/react_native_team_aua_thursday_oct_14_9am_pt/\">\u201CAsk Us Anything\u201C (AUA) on Reddit</a> and received over 100 questions! AUAs are a great opportunity for both us, to get a sense of the community engagement, and you all, to ask any kind of questions. If you haven\u2019t yet, make sure you check the answers as some of them are extremely insightful</li><li>We shared our <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision\">Many Platform Vision</a>, a guide for gotchas for <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/09/01/preparing-your-app-for-iOS-15-and-android-12\">Android 12 and iOS 15</a>, and the progress and <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/10/26/toward-hermes-being-the-default\">vision for Hermes to become the default JS engine</a> for React Native!</li><li>Our own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fkgozali\">Kevin Gozali</a> appeared on <a href=\"https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-222-the-new-architecture-with-kevin-gozali-from-the-rn-core-team\">an episode of React Native Radio podcast</a> to talk about the new architecture.</li><li>At <a href=\"https://conf.reactjs.org/\">ReactConf 2021</a>, ReactConf <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii\">Rick Hanlon</a> shared the unified many-platform vision for React and React Native. Moreover, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricRozell\">Eric Rozell</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moyessa\">Steven Moyes</a> got to share the amazing progress React Native Desktop has made in supporting both Meta and Microsoft apps and showcasing the Many Platform Vision in practice.</li></ul><p>Beyond sharing more updates in H2 2021, we also <strong>leaned</strong> on our community more than ever. We relied on critical feedback from contributors as they dogfooded early drafts of the New Architecture material. As well, we were heavily supported by the expertise of our community in debugging critical release issues and improvements.</p><p>There is a wealth of knowledge that our community brings into React Native, and we need to continue to nurture it.</p><h2>The New Architecture Rollout and Releases</h2><p>2022 is going to be the year of the <strong>New Architecture in open source</strong>.</p><p>We\u2019ve been working hard to deliver the infrastructure needed to rollout the New Architecture to apps and libraries. We involved some of our partners and core contributors/library maintainers to refine our support for the new architecture to get early stage feedback.</p><p>We are now preparing to release a new guide on our website: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/2879\">Getting Started with the New Architecture</a>. That will be the entry point to a collection of material that we\u2019re going to release in 2022 and will help you migrate/start your project with the new architecture.</p><p>Moreover, we would like to stress the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/2879\">importance of <strong>giving feedback</strong></a> on the New Architecture material. We\u2019re still in the process of finalizing the last details and your input will help everyone adopt the new architecture more seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Releases</strong> play a critical role in the New Architecture rollout. Our goal last half was to ensure any release blocking issues did not stagnate. We approached the problem by <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Releases\">clarifying and improving process and responsibilities</a> for better accountability. Our release coordination now occurs in a <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions\">dedicated discussions repository</a> with <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Needs%3A+Triage+%3Amag%3A%2CType%3A+Upgrade+Issue&template=upgrade-regression-form.yml\">clearer release issue reporting</a>.</p><p>In H1 2022, we will continue to iterate on release responsibilities to support new architecture rollout. If you\u2019d like to help out testing release candidates or <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/projects/18\">working on improvements</a>, feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions/categories/improvements\">join the discussion</a>!</p><h2>To Mobile and beyond</h2><p>As you can see from <a href=\"https://conf.reactjs.org/\">the ReactConf talk lineup</a>, React Native is not only Android & iOS.</p><p>Earlier in 2021, we shared our <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision\">Many Platform Vision</a>, and we had a successful time rolling out React Native on both Desktop and VR.</p><p>We\u2019re looking forward to <strong>converging patterns</strong> that are platform-specific into the React Native experience.</p><p>Finally, we want to thank again the community for the enormous support in H2 2021. It\u2019s always amazing to see how contributors come together and support each other on Github, fixing bugs, sharing their and helping us deliver React Native to millions of users.</p><p>Stay tuned and looking forward to an <strong>even more amazing 2022</strong> ð!</p> "

Naturally, many releases will focus on fixes and improvements.</p><p>Here are some notable changes coming in 0.67.0:</p><ul><li>Lean-core removals: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7a770526c626e6659a12939f8c61057a688aa623#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346\">DatePickerAndroid</a></li><li>Bump Gradle version to 7.2, Bump Kotlin version to 1.5.31 <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9ae3367431428748f5486c782199beb4f9c6b477\">Bump Kotlin and Gradle versions (#32319)</a></li><li>A notable callout: 0.67 continues to depend on Hermes 0.9.0, unchanged from 0.66</li></ul><p>You can find the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0670\">full changelog here</a>.</p><p>You can participate in the conversation on the status of this release at <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions/10\">this discussion</a> - and, as always, to help you upgrade to this version, you can use the <a href=\"https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/\">upgrade helper</a> âï¸</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><p>This release includes <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/0.66-stable...0.67-stable\">379 commits with 74 contributors</a>! Thank you, to all our contributors (old and new)! You can find the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0670\">full changelog here</a>.</p><p>We wanted to also thank the release testers who helped us make sure that 0.67.0 could reach your codebases without any massive regression. Specifically, we wanted to thank:</p><ul><li>Marc Rousavy (<a href=\"https://github.com/mrousavy\">@mrousavy</a>) from <a href=\"https://margelo.io/\">Margelo</a>, that surfaced a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/649\">regression for Hermes 0.10</a> (that would have never been caught on CI testing) which will be fixed in Hermes 0.11 in the 0.68 release of React Native.</li><li>The Reanimated team for quickly preparing a <a href=\"https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/releases/tag/2.2.4\">0.67 compatible version</a> of their lib early in the 0.67 RC phase.</li><li>Elias Nahum (<a href=\"https://github.com/enahum\">@enahum</a>) from <a href=\"https://mattermost.com/\">Mattermost</a></li><li>Mike Hardy (<a href=\"https://github.com/mikeHardy\">@mikeHardy</a>) working with <a href=\"https://invertase.io/\">Invertase</a></li></ul><p>We appreciate also <a href=\"https://rainbow.me/\">Rainbow</a>, <a href=\"https://comm.app/\">Comm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live\">Ledger Live</a> for also being part of the pilot of the \"Release Tester\" program (more details below).</p><h2>Improvements to Release Process</h2><p>As mentioned, React Native has been restructuring the release pipeline to allow for more frequent releases such that new features and fixes can roll out faster to the community.</p><p>Over the last few months we tackled some issues that delay releases.</p><h3>Coordination and Knowledge Sharing</h3><p>We invested in our documentation of releases to cover how to run a release, FAQs, coordination of release issues, etc \u2013 all of which can be found in this section of the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Releases\">react-native wiki</a>. By documentation, releases are no longer blocked on any individual or tribal knowledge.</p><p>In addition to documentation, we have also revamped the coordination of releases and have moved discussion of pre-release status and patches to a dedicated discussion group: <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions\">react-wg/react-native-releases</a>.</p><h3>Clarity of responsibility</h3><p>Following more documentation, release work can scale such that no one person is critical to running a release.</p><p>A React Native release is susceptible to a broad spectrum of potential points of failure and has a lot of dependencies and follow-up. Considering that usage of React Native varies across the community, it\u2019s essential to have stakeholders involved in releases. We have defined a set of <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Release-Roles-and-Responsibilities\">roles and responsibilities in supporting a release</a>.</p><h3>Release candidate signal</h3><p>Another issue with releases is getting a good signal that a release will not suffer from build regressions. This can be addressed with growing investment in testing build variants, etc. but signal from adoption will continue to be useful for some time.</p><p>In the 0.67 release we piloted a \u201CRelease Tester\u201D program where React Native developers working on Open Source apps <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Release-Roles-and-Responsibilities#release-tester-responsibilities\">commit to testing release candidates</a> on their apps. Prior, there was no formal expectation that the community will test out release candidates to raise any potential issues. This program helps us get faster signal to ensure a level of stability of the release.</p><p>Open source React Native apps are particularly useful due to availability of source code to help debug any regressions. With this program in place, a release tester surfaced a regression in 0.67 and we were able to resolve it without thrashing the larger community with a faulty release.</p><h2>Interested in helping React Native stabilise new releases?</h2><p>A great way to help us catch regressions is to integrate the React Native pre-release version <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native\"><code>react-native@next</code></a> or <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native\"><code>react-native@nightly</code></a> to your CI. For any regressions, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Needs%3A+Triage+%3Amag%3A%2CType%3A+Upgrade+Issue&template=upgrade-regression-form.yml\">file a release issue</a> and notify the appropriate discussion.</p><p>If your app or company is interested in joining the \u201CRelease Tester\u201D program, head to the dedicated section at the bottom of the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Release-Roles-and-Responsibilities#release-tester-responsibilities\">Release Roles and Responsibilities wiki</a> to learn more.</p><p>Lastly any help on trying our release candidates or helping unblock release issues is much appreciated!</p> "

In this post, we want to highlight some of the most exciting progress we&#x27;ve made over the past two years to push Hermes towards being <em>the best</em> JavaScript engine for React Native. Looking forward, we are confident that with these improvements and more to come, we can make Hermes the default JavaScript engine for React Native across all platforms.</p><h2>Optimizing for React Native</h2><p>Hermes\u2019s defining feature is how it performs compilation work ahead-of-time, meaning that React Native apps with Hermes enabled ship with precompiled optimized bytecode instead of plain JavaScript source. This drastically reduces the amount of work needed to start up your product for users. Measurements from both Facebook and community apps have suggested that enabling Hermes often cut a product\u2019s TTI (or <a href=\"https://web.dev/interactive/\">Time-To-Interactive</a>) metric by nearly half.</p><p>That being said, we\u2019ve been working on improving Hermes in many other aspects to make it even better as a JavaScript engine specialized for React Native.</p><h3>Building a New Garbage Collector for Fabric</h3><p>With the upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4\">Fabric</a> renderer in the new React Native architecture, it will be possible to synchronously call JavaScript on the UI thread. However, this means if the JavaScript thread takes too long to execute, it can cause noticeable UI frame drops and block user inputs. The <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html\">concurrent rendering</a> enabled by React <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-react-fiber\">Fiber</a> will avoid scheduling long JavaScript tasks by splitting rendering work into chunks. However, there is another common source of latency from the JavaScript thread \u2014 when the JavaScript engine has to \u201Cstop the world\u201D to perform a garbage collection (GC).</p><p>The previous default garbage collector in Hermes, <a href=\"https://hermesengine.dev/docs/gengc/\">GenGC</a>, was a single-threaded generational garbage collector. The new generations uses a typical semi-space copying strategy, and the old generations uses a mark-compact strategy to make it really good at aggressively returning memory to the operating system. Due to its single-thread, GenGC has the downside of causing long GC pauses. On apps that are as complicated as Facebook for Android, we observed an average pause of 200ms, or 1.4s at p99. We have even seen it be as long as 7 seconds, considering the large and diverse user base of Facebook for Android.</p><p>In order to mitigate this, we implemented a brand new <em>mostly concurrent</em> GC named <a href=\"https://hermesengine.dev/docs/hades\">Hades</a>. Hades collects its young generation exactly the same as GenGC, but it manages its old generation with a snapshot-at-the-beginning style mark-sweep collector. which can significantly reduce GC pause time by performing most of its work in a background thread without blocking the engine\u2019s main thread from executing JavaScript code. <strong>Our statistics show that Hades only pauses for 48ms at p99.9 on 64-bit devices (34x faster than GenGC!)</strong> and around 88ms at p99.9 on 32-bit devices (where it operates as a single-threaded <em>incremental</em> GC). These pause time improvements can come at the cost of overall throughput, due to the need for more expensive write barriers, slower freelist based allocation (as opposed to a bump pointer allocator), and increased heap fragmentation. We think those are the right trade-offs, and we were able to achieve overall lower memory consumption via coalescing and additional memory optimizations that we\u2019ll talk about.</p><h3>Striking on Performance Pain Points</h3><p>Startup time of applications is critical to the success of many apps, and we are continuously pushing the boundary for React Native. For any new JavaScript feature we implement in Hermes, we carefully monitor their impact on production performance and ensure that they don\u2019t regress metrics. At Facebook, we are currently experimenting with a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro/blob/c9a6fd75937c56645ab9e4d88fa820e63e057cd6/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset/src/configs/main.js#L42\">dedicated Babel transform profile for Hermes in Metro</a> to replace a dozen Babel transforms with Hermes\u2019s native ESNext implementations. We were able to observe <strong>18-25% TTI improvements</strong> on many surfaces and <strong>overall bytecode size decreases</strong> and we expect to see similar results for OSS.</p><p>In addition to startup performance, we identified memory footprint as an opportunity for improvement in React Native apps especially for <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision#expanding-to-new-platforms\">virtual reality.</a> Thanks to the low-level control we have as a JavaScript engine, we were able to deliver rounds of memory optimizations by squeezing bits and bytes out:</p><ol><li>Previously, all JavaScript values were represented as 64-bit NaN-boxing encoded tagged values to represent floating point doubles and pointers on 64-bit architecture. However, this is wasteful in practice because most numbers are small integers (SMI) and JavaScript heap of client-side applications is not expected to be larger than 4GiB generally. To address this, we introduced a new 32-bit encoding in which SMI and pointers are encoded in 29 bits (because pointers are 8-byte aligned, we can assume the bottom 3 bits are always zero), and the rest of JS numbers are boxed onto the heap. <strong>This reduced the JavaScript heap size by ~30%.</strong></li><li>Different kinds of JavaScript objects are represented as different kinds of GC-managed cells in the JavaScript heap. By aggressively optimizing the memory layout of headers for those cells, <strong>we are able to reduce memory usage by another ~15%</strong>.</li></ol><p>One of our key decisions with Hermes was to not implement a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation\">just-in-time (JIT) compiler</a> because we believe that for most React Native apps, the additional warm-up costs and extra footprints on binary and memory would not actually be worthwhile. For years, we invested a lot of effort in optimizing interpreter performance and compiler optimizations to make Hermes\u2019s throughput competitive with other engines for React Native workloads. We are continuing to focus on improving throughput by identifying performance bottlenecks from everywhere (interpreter dispatch loop, stack layout, object model, GC, etc.). Expect some more numbers in upcoming releases!</p><h3>Pioneering at Vertical Integrations</h3><p>At Facebook, we prefer to colocate projects within a large <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo\">monorepo</a>. By having the engine (Hermes) and the host (React Native) closely iterating together, we opened a lot of room for vertical integrations. To name a few:</p><ul><li>Hermes supports <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes#debugging-js-on-hermes-using-google-chromes-devtools\">on-device JavaScript debugging with the Chrome debugger</a> by speaking the <a href=\"https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/\">Chrome DevTools Protocol</a>. It\u2019s better than the legacy \u201C<a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools\">Remote JS Debugging</a>\u201D (which uses an in-app proxy to run JS in desktop Chrome) because it supports debugging synchronous native calls and guaranteed a consistent runtime environment. Together with React DevTools, Metro, Inspector, and so on, Hermes debugger is now part of <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2020/03/26/version-0.62\">Flipper</a> to provide a one-stop developer experience.</li><li>Objects allocated during the initialization path of React Native apps are often long-lived and don\u2019t follow the <em>generational</em> <em>hypothesis</em> leveraged by generational GCs. Therefore, we <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/hermes/reactexecutor/OnLoad.cpp#L37-L42\">configured Hermes in React Native</a> to allocate the first 32MiB directly into old generations (known as <em>pre-tenuring</em>) to avoid triggering GC pauses and delaying TTI.</li><li>The new React Native architecture is heavily based on <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/91\">JSI (or JavaScript Interface)</a>, a lightweight, general-purposed API for embedding a JavaScript engine into a C++ program. By having the team maintaining the JS engine also maintains the JSI API implementation, we are confident in providing the best possible integration that is reliable, performant and battle-tested at the Facebook\u2019s scale.</li><li>Getting JavaScript concurrency primitives (e.g. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises\">promises</a>) and platform concurrency primitives (e.g. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide\">microtasks</a>) both semantically correct and performant are critical to React concurrent rendering and the future of React Native apps. Historically, promises in React Native were <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/Libraries/Core/polyfillPromise.js#L37\">polyfilled</a> using non-standardized <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setImmediate\"><code>setImmediate</code></a> APIs. We are working on making native promises and microtasks from JS engines available via JSI, and introducing <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/queueMicrotask\"><code>queueMicrotask</code></a>, a recent addition to the web standard, to the platform, to better support modern asynchronous JavaScript code.</li></ul><h2>Bringing Along the Whole Community</h2><p>Hermes has been really great for us at Facebook. But our work is not done until our community can use Hermes to power experiences throughout the ecosystem, so that everyone leverage all of its features and to embrace its full potential.</p><h3>Expanding to New Platforms</h3><p>Hermes was initially open sourced only for React Native on Android. Since then, we have been thrilled to see our members of the community expanding Hermes support into <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision\">many other platforms that React Native\u2019s ecosystem has expanded</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://callstack.com/\">Callstack</a> led the effort of bringing <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/03/12/version-0.64\">Hermes to iOS in React Native 0.64</a>. They wrote a <a href=\"https://callstack.com/blog/bringing-hermes-to-ios-in-react-native/\">series of articles</a> and hosted a <a href=\"https://callstack.com/podcasts/react-native-0-64-with-hermes-for-ios-ep-5\">podcast</a> on how they achieved it. According to their benchmarks, Hermes was able to <strong>consistently deliver ~40% improvement to startup and ~18% reduced memory on iOS</strong> compared to JSC for the Mattermost app, with only 2.4 MiB of app size overhead. I encourage you to <a href=\"https://callstack.com/blog/hermes-performance-on-ios/\">see it live with your own eyes</a>.</p><p>Microsoft has been bringing <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/hermes\">Hermes to React Native for Windows and macOS</a>. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QMFbrHZnvvw?t=389\">At Microsoft Build 2020</a>, Microsoft shared that Hermes\u2019s memory impact (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set\">working set</a>) is 13% lower than the Chakra engine on React Native for Windows. Recently, on some synthetic benchmarks, they\u2019ve found Hermes 0.8 (shipped with Hades and aforementioned SMI and pointer compression optimization) <strong>uses 30%-40% less memory than other engines</strong>. Not surprisingly, the <a href=\"https://www.messenger.com/desktop\">desktop Messenger</a> video calling experience built on React Native, is also powered by Hermes.</p><p>Last but not least, Hermes has also been powering all virtual reality experiences built with the React family of technologies on Oculus, including Oculus Home.</p><h3>Supporting our Community</h3><p>We acknowledge there are still blockers that prevent parts of the community from adopting Hermes and we are committed to building support for these missing features. Our goal is to be fully featured so that Hermes is the right choice for most React Native apps. Here is how the community has already shaped the Hermes roadmap:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Meta_programming\"><code>Proxy</code> and <code>Reflect</code></a> were originally excluded from Hermes because Facebook does not use them. We were also concerned that adding Proxy would hurt property lookup performance even when Proxy is not used. But Proxy quickly become <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/33\">the most requested feature</a> of Hermes due to popular libraries such as <a href=\"https://mobx.js.org/README.html\">MobX</a> and <a href=\"https://immerjs.github.io/immer/\">Immer</a>. We carefully evaluated and decided to build it just for the community, and we managed to implement it with very low cost. Since this is a feature we don\u2019t use, we relied on our community to prove its stability. We started by testing Proxy behind a flag and created opt-in npm packages for <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/33#issuecomment-668374607\">release v0.4</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/33#issuecomment-668374607\">v0.5</a>, and it\u2019s <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/releases/tag/v0.7.0\">enabled by default starting from v0.7</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://hermesengine.dev/docs/intl\">ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification (ECMA-402, or <code>Intl</code>)</a> was <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/23\">the second most requested feature</a>. <code>Intl</code> is a huge set of APIs and often requires the implementation to include <strong>6MB worth</strong> of <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index\">Unicode CLDR</a> data. This is why polyfills like <a href=\"https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs\">FormatJS (a.k.a. <code>react-intl</code>)</a> and JS engines like the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts#international-variant\">international variant build of community JSC</a> are so huge. To avoid substantially increasing the binary size of Hermes, we decided to implement it with another strategy by consuming and mapping the ICU facilities provided by the libraries included in the operating systems, at the cost of some (often minor) variance in behaviors across platforms.<ul><li>Microsoft collaborated to build support on Android. It covers almost everything from ECMA-402 up to ES2020, <strong>with only a size impact as small as 3% (57-62K per ABI)</strong>. We ran <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tmikov/status/1336442786694893568\">a poll on Twitter</a> and the results were strongly in favor of including <code>Intl</code> by default, so that\u2019s what we did and it\u2019s available starting from <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/releases/tag/v0.8.0\">release v0.8</a>.</li><li>Facebook has sponsored <a href=\"https://mlh.io/\">Major League Hacking</a> to launch a <a href=\"https://news.mlh.io/welcoming-facebook-back-as-a-sponsor-of-the-2020-2021-mlh-fellowship-08-12-2020\">remote open source fellowship program</a>. Last year, we launched the <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/profile-hermes\">Hermes sampling profiler</a>. This year, our fellows will be working with members from Hermes, React Native, and Callstack, to add support for Hermes <code>Intl</code> on iOS. Stayed tuned!</li></ul></li><li>We appreciate that people have been working with us to discover issues affecting the community.<ul><li>People have helped us identify critical spec divergence such as <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/212\">stability of <code>Array.prototype.sort</code></a> amended in <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1340\">ES2019</a>. This has been fixed and will be available in the next release.</li><li>People found out that our default heap size limit was too small and caused <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/295\">unnecessary GC pressure</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/511\">OOM crashes</a> for many users who are not familiar with customizing Hermes\u2019s GC configs. So we increased it from 512MiB to 3GiB to be more than sufficient for most users by default.</li><li>People also reported that our specialized <code>Function.prototype.toString</code> implementation <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/471#issuecomment-820123463\">caused performance to drop in libraries doing improper feature detection</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/114#issuecomment-887106990\">blocked users from doing source code injecting</a>. This helped us strengthen our stance that Hermes, whenever possible, should not get in the way of developers and to respect de-facto practices.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>In summary, our vision is to make Hermes ready to be the default JavaScript engine across all React Native platforms. We\u2019ve already started working towards it, and we want to hear from all of you about this direction.</p><p>It\u2019s extremely important for us to prepare the ecosystem for a smooth adoption. We encourage you to try out Hermes, and file issues on our <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes\">GitHub repository</a> for any feedbacks, questions, feature requests and incompatibilities.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>We\u2019d love to thank the Hermes team, the React Native team, and the many contributors from the React Native community for their work to improve Hermes.</p><p>I\u2019d also love to personally thank (in alphabetic order) Eli White, Luna Wei, Neil Dhar, Tim Yung, Tzvetan Mikov, and many others for their help during the writing.</p> "

As part of this effort we are working to make React Native more stable on main and to reduce the bugs identified during our Release Candidate process.</p><p>While we have been publishing nightly releases of React Native for over a year, these releases haven\u2019t been effectively used by most projects. They are now easier to access and we hope to use them as release candidates going forward. Nightly releases are published to npm under the \u201Cnightly\u201D tag.</p><p>To improve the process of testing individual commits, React Native\u2019s CI will now create a tarball artifact for each commit on the main and release branches as well as for each PR. We refer to them as commitlies. These commitlies will not be published to npm, but they can be downloaded directly from CircleCI. See instructions below.</p><p>Want to help get a PR merged? By trying out the related commitly and verifying the change, you will be providing valuable signal to help get the change landed!</p><h4>Using Nightly Releases (Nightlies)</h4><p>The process for migrating your project to a React Native nightly release is very similar to the one you would follow when upgrading to a regular version, with the exception that tools like the Upgrade Helper do not currently work with nightlies. With that in mind, we recommend that you first upgrade your project to the most recent stable release if you have not done so yet. Then, run <code>yarn upgrade react-native@nightly</code> to install the most recent nightly release. Note that there may be additional changes that are needed for your project to work properly on a nightly release.</p><h4>Using Commitly Releases (Commitlies)</h4><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/0.66-artifact.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of CircleCi artifact panel to find tarball\"/><figcaption>Find the \"build_npm_package-1\" job related to a commit and head to the \"Artifacts\" panel to download the tarball for the commitly.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like with a nightly release, first make sure that your project has been upgraded to the most recent stable version. Then, go to the <a href=\"https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/facebook/react-native\"><code>react-native</code> dashboard on Circle CI</a> and look up the workflow that was triggered by the commit in question. There, you should see a job named <code>build_npm_package</code>. That job will have an \u201CArtifacts\u201D panel which will provide a link that you may use to download a tarball file. You can then run the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Update your react-native dependency to the tarball # using your preferred package manager $ yarn add <path to tarball> $ npm add <path to tarball> </code></pre><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><p>This release includes <strong>621 commits</strong> with <strong>92 contributors</strong>!

Please also account for App Store review time if any changes are required to prepare your app for iOS 15.</p><h3>What to watch out for</h3><h4>QuickType Bar</h4><p>The way to disable <em>QuickType</em> bar in <em><a href=\"/docs/textinput\">TextInput</a></em> has changed. <em>QuickType</em> bar is the bar above keyboard with three suggested words. In case your UI needs to have the bar hidden, setting <a href=\"/docs/textinput#autocorrect\">autoCorrect</a> to <code>false</code> no longer disables <em>QuickType</em> bar in iOS 15 like earlier versions. In order to hide the <em>QuickType</em> bar, you need to also set <a href=\"/docs/textinput#spellcheck-ios\">spellCheck</a> to <code>false</code>. This will disable spell check, the red underlines, in your <em>TextInput</em>. Disabling QuickType bar with spell check enabled is no longer an option.</p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/ios-15-quicktype-bar.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of QuickType bar\"/><figcaption>QuickType bar with three suggested words</figcaption></figure><p>To disable QuickType bar in iOS 15, set prop <a href=\"/docs/textinput#spellcheck-ios\">spellCheck</a> and <a href=\"/docs/textinput#autocorrect\">autoCorrect</a> to <code>false</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\"><TextInput placeholder=\"something\" autoCorrect={false} spellCheck={false} /> </code></pre><h4>Transparent Navigation Bar</h4><p>iOS 15 changes the default behaviour of the navigation bar. Unlike in iOS 14, the navigation bar becomes transparent when the content is scrolled all the way up. Make sure to watch out for this as it can make content difficult to read. For tips on how to work around this issue, check out <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682420\">this thread</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/ios-15-navigation-bar.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of navigation bar on iOS 14 and iOS 15\"/></p><h3>How to install iOS 15</h3><h4>Device</h4><p>If you have a spare device, you can join the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">beta program</a> and install iOS 15. At this point, beta releases are generally stable, but keep in mind that <strong>the upgrade to iOS 15 is irreversible</strong>.</p><h4>Simulator</h4><p>To test your app on a simulator with iOS 15, you will need to download Xcode 13. You can find Xcode 13 <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\">here</a>.</p><h2>Android 12</h2><p>Android 12 will be released this autumn and it introduces some changes which can potentially affect your app experience. Traditionally, Google Play requires target SDK of your app to be upgraded before November of the following year. (see requirements for previous release <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk\">here</a>).</p><h3>What to watch out for</h3><h4>Overscroll Effect</h4><p>Android 12 introduces new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/overscroll\">overscroll effect</a> which affects all scroll containers. As React Native scroll views are based on the native views, we recommend to check your scrollable containers to ensure the effect is applied correctly. You can opt-out from it by setting <a href=\"/docs/scrollview#overscrollmode-android\"><code>overScrollMode</code></a> prop to <code>never</code>.</p><h4>Permission Updates</h4><p>Android 12 allows users of your app to only provide access to the approximate location if you request it with <strong><code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code></strong> permission<strong>.</strong> Learn more about it <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/approximate-location\">here</a>.</p><p>Check out Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all\">detailed behavior changes</a> for all apps running on Android 12.</p><h3>How to install Android 12</h3><h4>Device</h4><p>If you have a spare Android device, check if you\u2019re able to install Android 12 Beta via <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get\">instructions here.</a></p><h4>Emulator</h4><p>If you don\u2019t have a device available, you can set up an emulator following <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get#on_emulator\">instructions here</a>.</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>React Native has been very successful at raising the bar for mobile development, both at Facebook and elsewhere in the industry. As we interact with computers in new ways and as new devices are invented, we want React Native to be there for everyone. Although React Native was originally created to build mobile apps, we believe that focusing on many platforms and building to each platform\u2019s strengths and constraints has a symbiotic effect. We have seen huge benefits when we extended this technology to desktop and virtual reality, and we&#x27;re excited to share what this means for the future of React Native.</p><h2>Respecting the Platform</h2><p>Our first guiding principle is <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2020/07/17/react-native-principles#native-experience\">to match the expectations people have for each platform</a>. Android users expect accessible apps using TalkBack. Navigation should work the way it does in other Android apps. A button should look and feel the way buttons look and feel on Android. It should not look and feel like an iOS button. Although we seek to offer a consistent cross-platform developer experience, we resist the temptation to sacrifice users\u2019 expectations.</p><p>We believe that React Native enables developers to meet users\u2019 expectations while also gaining the benefits of a better developer experience. In this section, we share the following:</p><ol><li>By embracing platform constraints, we actually improve the experience on other platforms.</li><li>We can learn from institutional knowledge to build higher level cross-platform abstractions.</li><li>Other players on each platform inspire us to build better developer and user experiences.</li></ol><h3>Embracing Platform Constraints</h3><p>Specific device hardware or user expectations impose unique constraints and requirements. As an example, memory is typically more constrained on Android and VR headsets than on iOS, macOS, and Windows. As another example, users expect mobile apps to start up almost instantaneously, but they are less frustrated when desktop apps take longer to start up. <strong>We have found that by approaching these problems with React Native, we can more easily borrow lessons learned and code written for one platform, and apply them to other platforms.</strong></p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/many-platform-vision-facebook-dating.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Facebook Dating on mobile\"/><figcaption>React Native and Relay power over 1000 Facebook surfaces on Android and iOS.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, React Native relies on an optimization known as \u201Cview flattening\u201D which is critical for reducing memory usage on Android. We never built this optimization for iOS because it does not bear the same memory constraints. Over the past few years as we built our new cross-platform renderer, we had to reimplement \u201Cview flattening\u201D. But this time, it was written in C++ instead of platform-specific Java. Trying out this same optimization on iOS was now only a matter of flipping a switch. In the production Facebook app, we observed that this improved performance on iOS! We likely never would have built this for iOS, but our investment on Android was able to benefit our investment on iOS.</p><h3>Learning from Institutional Knowledge</h3><p>One of the reasons that React Native was originally created was to reduce engineering silos. There is a tendency for Android engineers to be siloed from iOS engineers working on the same product. Android engineers review code for Android engineers and attend Android meetups and conferences. iOS engineers review code for iOS engineers and attend iOS meetups and conferences. Engineers working on different platforms bring unique domain and institutional knowledge about how to build great product experiences.</p><p>One of the best outcomes of cross-platform frameworks like React Native is how they bring together engineers with vastly different domain expertise. <strong>We believe that by targeting more platforms, we can accelerate cross-pollination of institutional knowledge between platform experts.</strong></p><p>As an example, the accessibility abstractions in React Native are influenced by how Android, iOS, and web each approach accessibility in different ways. This enabled us to build a common interface that improves how accessibility hints are handled on both mobile platforms.</p><p>As another example, our research into user perception of speed on the web led to concurrent features like Suspense. Over the past year, these features were vetted by the new <a href=\"http://facebook.com/\">Facebook.com</a> website. Now with our new renderer, these features are making their way to React Native and influencing how we design event scheduling and priorities. The React team\u2019s investment into improving the web experience is benefiting React Native for native platforms.</p><h3>Competition Drives Innovation</h3><p>In addition to domain-specific engineers and meetups and conferences, each platform also brings other unique players solving similar problems. On the web, React (which directly powers React Native) frequently draws inspiration from other open source web frameworks like <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a>, <a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\">Preact</a>, and <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a>. On mobile, React Native has been inspired by other open source mobile frameworks, and we have been learning from other mobile frameworks built inside Facebook.</p><p><strong>We believe that competition leads to better outcomes for everyone in the long run.</strong> By studying what makes other players on each platform great, we can learn lessons that may apply to other platforms. For example, the race to simplify complex websites influenced the development of React and gave React Native a head start to offer a declarative framework for mobile apps. The demand for faster iteration cycles and build times for the web also led to the development of Fast Refresh which significantly benefited React Native. Similarly, performance optimizations in our internal mobile frameworks \u2014 especially around data fetching and parallelization \u2014 challenged us to improve React Native in a way that has also influenced React when we built the new <a href=\"http://facebook.com/\">Facebook.com</a> website.</p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/many-platform-vision-facebook-website.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Facebook.com website\"/><figcaption>React and Relay powers the <a href=\"http://facebook.com/\">Facebook.com</a> website.</figcaption></figure><h2>Expanding to New Platforms</h2><p>React and React Native are at a turning point. React has <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html\">started the road to a React 18 release</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1415099806507167745\">the new React Native renderer is now fully powering the Facebook mobile apps</a>. Our team has grown substantially this year in order to support the growing adoption at Facebook. Teams developing on other platforms have noticed the adoption and see the opportunity for them to also reap the benefits of React Native.</p><p><strong>For the past year, we have been partnering with Microsoft and the Messenger team to create a truly native video calling experience on Windows and macOS.</strong> Due to the high scrutiny that we place on startup time for mobile apps, our initial implementation of desktop video calling using React Native completely blew away the performance of the Electron implementation that it replaced. For the first couple weeks of building this experience, we recorded videos of us resizing a window with multiple live video calls and marveled at the smooth frame rates.</p><p>Building for desktop has been very exciting for us. We have taken what we know about building mobile experiences and applied them to desktop with eyes wide open. We\u2019ve expanded our horizons with multiple child windows, menu bars, system trays, and more. As we continue collaborating on new desktop Messenger features, we expect to find opportunities that influence how we build on web and mobile. If you want to stay up to date, our desktop collaboration work is taking place <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows\">on GitHub</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/many-platform-vision-messenger-desktop.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Messenger app on macOS\"/><figcaption>React Native powers Video Calling in Messenger for Windows and macOS.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>We are also partnering more closely with <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/\">Facebook Reality Labs</a> to understand how React is uniquely positioned to deliver virtual reality experiences on Oculus.</strong> Building experiences in VR with React Native will be particularly interesting because of tighter memory constraints and user sensitivity to interaction latency.</p><p>Similar to how we approach React Native for mobile, we will be validating our technology at Facebook scale before we share anything publicly. A lot is still changing and we still have many questions. We want to have confidence that the technology is production-ready and reliable before sharing with the community.</p><p>Although most of the development for VR will still be internal, we hope to share more as soon as we can. We also anticipate that improvements to React Native for VR will surface in open source. For example, we anticipate that projects to reduce memory usage for VR use cases will also reduce memory usage for React Native on mobile and desktop experiences.</p><figure><img src=\"/blog/assets/many-platform-vision-oculus-home.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Oculus Home in virtual reality\"/><figcaption>React and Relay power the Oculus Home and many other virtual reality experiences.</figcaption></figure><p>When we reflect back on how the industry has adopted React, there has always been an appetite in the community for React on more platforms. Even before we announced React Native to the community, Netflix had already been crafting Gibbon, their custom renderer for building TV experiences with React. And before Facebook started building Messenger for desktop, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUMWFExtDSg&t=382s\">Microsoft was already using React to build native desktop experiences in Office and Windows 10</a>.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In summary, our vision is to expand React Native&#x27;s reach beyond mobile and we&#x27;ve already started by partnering with desktop and VR teams at Facebook. We know that when we embrace the platform constraints of each platform, learn from institutional knowledge, and gather inspiration from other players, it benefits every platform in the ecosystem. And most importantly, in doing so, we stay true to <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2020/07/17/react-native-principles\">our guiding principles</a>.</p><p>We are excited about what&#x27;s to come as we continue to explore what many platforms unlocks for React Native. Connect with us (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative\">@reactnative</a>) for more updates and share your thoughts!</p> "

We&#x27;ve welcomed new members to our team (whom we are excited to eventually meet in person!), our projects have matured and new opportunities have arisen. We&#x27;re excited to share all this with you in this post and others to come!</p><p>At Facebook, our team works in half-year cycles. Each half we review our strategy, set plans, and share them internally. Today, we want to share our H2 plans with you, our community.</p><p>H2 2021 is an exciting half for React Native. Our areas of focus include nurturing the community, beginning to roll out the new architecture to open source, and pushing the technology forward.</p><h2>Setting up the Community for Success</h2><p>React Native\u2019s open source ecosystem is one of its greatest strengths. We\u2019ve identified the following areas as the best ways to grow our partnership with the community.</p><h3>Community Engagement</h3><p>In order for everyone to move in the same direction, we want to continually communicate our vision and status to the community. Sharing our incremental progress publicly isn\u2019t second-nature for us (yet). This half, we are committing to a more consistent content schedule that exercises the muscle and sets up processes to reduce friction. Beyond sharing our updates, we also want to use this opportunity to showcase the accomplishments of the community.</p><h3>New Architecture Rollout and Releases</h3><p>In H1, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1415099806507167745\">we finished rolling out the new React Native architecture</a> to all React Native mobile products in the Facebook app. Facebook is made up of surfaces like Marketplace Tab and Dating Profile, and we have migrated over 1000 surfaces!</p><p>In H2, we are beginning to bring this new architecture to the community. We have put together a playbook that shows how to migrate libraries and applications. We have already shared drafts with early partners that maintain popular React Native libraries. We expect to get their feedback, support them in upgrading their libraries, and learn how to improve our playbook and implementations. We plan on sharing the playbook more broadly as soon as the work stabilizes.</p><p>We are also focused on improving React Native\u2019s release process. We will need frequent reliable releases to progressively ship the new React Native architecture. Our aim is to catch release-blockers earlier and to reduce the turn-around time. This will enable more predictable release timelines with less burden on contributors and developers.</p><h3>Repository Health</h3><p>When developers evaluate a technology, an essential signal is the health of its repository. This impression is informed by signals such as pull request throughput, stars, age of last commit, and others. The React Native repository has historically lacked a process to ensure that issues and pull requests are reviewed in a timely manner. Our work this half is two-fold: we need to resolve a large backlog of contributions, and we need to build sustainable practices for handling incoming contributions. We hope this work will also set us up for success for more engagement from the community via issues and PRs as the community starts using the new architecture. You can follow our progress on the backlog using this <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/projects/17\">project board.</a></p><h2>Pushing the Technology Forward</h2><h3>New Architectural Capabilities</h3><p>As mentioned, our new architecture recently finished rolling out to the Facebook mobile apps! We are already building new capabilities that will change the performance curve for React Native. This includes supporting Concurrent Rendering in React Native. Concurrent Rendering enables React to pause and resume work and quickly respond to high priority events like a touch gesture. Something we are also really excited about is using Concurrent Rendering to make use of idle CPU cycles for rendering offscreen product features without slowing down onscreen user interactions.</p><h3>Mobile and Beyond</h3><p>We have had overwhelming success with powering mobile experiences using React at Facebook, and we have seen amazing mobile products from our partners. Now we want to bring that success to more platforms! We believe that targeting many platforms lets us learn new lessons and further improve our offering on mobile platforms. (We will share more about this in a later post.) The exciting news is that we\u2019ve already started taking steps towards making this a reality!</p><h4>Messenger Desktop</h4><p>Last summer, we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1286061933293010944\">expanded our focus beyond mobile</a> by partnering with Microsoft to accelerate React Native development on Windows and macOS. We partnered with the Messenger team at Facebook to enable user experiences that are only possible on desktop, and to deliver huge performance wins over their previous Electron implementation. Our vision is to combine high quality, delightful, <em>native</em> desktop user experiences with the great developer experience of React Native.</p><p>The Messenger team has ambitious plans for the Messenger desktop apps, including finding new ways to further unleash the unique capabilities of desktop platforms and large screens. We are excited to continue enabling these experiences by investing more into React Native on desktop.</p><h4>React Native in Virtual Reality</h4><p>Oculus has long used React Native to power core experiences like Store, where people buy applications and games in VR. In H2, React Native and Oculus are partnering to bring new exciting experiences to VR. We are also bringing optimizations and improvements from VR to mobile, and from mobile to VR. This will include expanding React Native to support unique requirements of VR \u2014 from new input types like controllers to new memory usage optimizations. This is the start of an exciting journey to explore and influence how immersive experiences can built for VR using React Native.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>We hope our H2 plans excite you as much as it does us, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the upcoming months! We will also be attending React Native EU on September 1, 2021 where teammate Joshua Gross (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshuaisgross\">@joshuaisgross</a>) will share how we replaced the architecture for the world\u2019s largest React Native app. <a href=\"https://www.react-native.eu/\">Register for React Native EU</a> if you haven\u2019t already! In the meantime, connect with us on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative\">@reactnative</a>) for updates on events, our roadmap, and much more.</p> "

Now seven components announce their disabled state or disable click functionality.</p><p>Announces when Disabled</p><ul><li><p><code>Button</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31001\">#31001</a></p></li><li><p><code>Images</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31252\">#31252</a></p></li><li><p><code>ImageBackground</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31252\">#31252</a></p></li></ul><p>Disables click functionality when the component has a disabled prop</p><ul><li><p><code>Button</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31001\">#31001</a></p></li><li><p><code>Text</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/33ff4445dcf858cd5e6ba899163fd2a76774b641\">React Native Team commit</a></p></li><li><p><code>Pressable</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1c7d9c8046099eab8db4a460bedc0b2c07ed06df\">React Native Team commit</a></p></li><li><p><code>TouchableHighlight</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31135\">#31135</a></p></li><li><p><code>TouchableOpacity</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31108\">#31108</a></p></li><li><p><code>TouchableNativeFeedback</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31224\">#31224</a></p></li><li><p><code>TouchableWithoutFeedback</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31297\">#31297</a></p></li></ul><h3>Selected State Announcement</h3><p>There were some components that did not announce their selection when in focus. This behavior has now been fixed when the component is in focus and the AccessibilityState is set to selected or the component is changed to selected.</p><p>Announces when Selected</p><ul><li><p><code>Button</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31001\">#31001</a></p></li><li><p><code>TextInput</code> - <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31144\">#31144</a></p></li></ul><h3>Accessibility Timeout Setting</h3><p>There was previously no way to query the accessibility timeout setting on Android. The fix added the ability to query <code>AccessibilityManager.getRecommendedTimeoutMillis()</code>. This queries the \"Time to take action\" before the UI elements auto-dismisses or auto-progresses.</p><h2>Documentation Additions</h2><p>The React Native documentation must be updated to reflect each addition or change to the available APIs. The <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/accessibilityinfo#getrecommendedtimeoutmillis-android\">new addition to the React Native documentation</a> covered the addition of <code>getRecommendedTimeoutMillis()</code> to AccessibilityInfo.</p><h2>Community Involvement</h2><p>We want to thank all the contributors mentioned below who have submitted and merged pull requests as well as those who have reviewed and commented on issues.</p><h3>Merged Pull Requests</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/huzaifaaak\">@huzaifaaak</a> closed 3 issues with:<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31001\">Added talkback support for button accessibility: disabled prop #31001</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31189\">Accessibility/button test #31189</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/natural_clar\">@natural_clar</a> closed 1 issue with:<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31135\">feat: set disabled accessibilityState when <code>TouchableHighlight</code> is disabled #31135</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/fabriziobertoglio1987\">fabriziobertoglio1987</a> closed 2 issues with:<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31144\">[Android] Selected State does not annonce when <code>TextInput</code> Component selected #31144</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31252\">Accessibility Fix Image does not announce \"disabled\" #31252</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kyamashiro73\">@kyamashiro73</a> closed 1 issue with:<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31224\">Added talkback support for <code>TouchableNativeFeedback</code> accessibility: disabled prop #31224</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dkrk0901\">@grgr-dkrk</a> closed 1 issue and added to the React Native documentation with:<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31063\">add <code>getRecommendedTimeoutMillis</code> to AccessibilityInfo #31063</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/2581\">feat: add <code>getRecommendedTimeoutMillis</code> section on accessibilityInfo #2581</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/crloscuesta\">@crloscuesta</a> closed 1 issue with:<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31297\">Disable accessibilityState when <code>TouchableWithoutFeedback</code> is disabled #31297</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chakrihacker\">@chakrihacker</a> closed 1 issue with:<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31108\">Disable <code>TouchableOpacity</code> when accessibility disabled is set #31108</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>Thank you to the community members who gave their time in other ways!</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/Simek\">Simek</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/saurabhkacholiya\">saurabhkacholiya</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/meehawk\">meehawk</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/intergalacticspacehighway\">intergalacticspacehighway</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisglein\">chrisglein</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jychiao\">jychiao</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Waltari10\">Waltari10</a></p><h2>Get Involved!</h2><p>We&#x27;ve come a long way but we&#x27;re not done yet.

            "#cdata-section": " <p>Today we\u2019re releasing React Native 0.64 that ships with support for Hermes on iOS.</p><h2>Hermes opt-in on iOS</h2><p><a href=\"https://hermesengine.dev\">Hermes</a> is an open source JavaScript engine optimized for running React Native. It improves performance by decreasing memory utilization, reducing download size and decreasing the time it takes for the app to become usable or \u201Ctime to interactive\u201D (TTI).</p><p>With this release, we are happy to announce that you can now use Hermes to build on iOS as well. To enable Hermes on iOS, set <code>hermes_enabled</code> to <code>true</code> in your <code>Podfile</code> and run <code>pod install</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">use_react_native!( :path => config[:reactNativePath], # to enable hermes on iOS, change `false` to `true` and then install pods :hermes_enabled => true ) </code></pre><p>Please keep in mind that Hermes support on iOS is still early stage. We are keeping it as an opt-in as we are running further benchmarking. We encourage you to try it on your own applications and let us know how it is working out for you!</p><h2>Inline Requires enabled by default</h2><p>Inline Requires is a Metro configuration option that improves startup time by delaying execution of JavaScript modules until they are used, instead of at startup.</p><p>This feature has existed and been recommended for a few years as an opt-in configuration option, listed in the <a href=\"/docs/performance\">Performance section of our documentation</a>. We are now enabling this option by default for new applications to help people have fast React Native applications without extra configuration.</p><p>Inline Requires is a Babel transform that takes module imports and converts them to be inline. As an example, Inline Requires transforms this module import call from being at the top of the file to where it is used.</p><p><strong>Before:</strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { MyFunction } from &#x27;my-module&#x27;; const MyComponent = (props) => { const result = MyFunction(); return <Text>{result}</Text>; }; </code></pre><p><strong>After:</strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const MyComponent = (props) => { const result = require(&#x27;my-module&#x27;).MyFunction(); return <Text>{result}</Text>; }; </code></pre><p>More information about Inline Requires is available in the <a href=\"/docs/ram-bundles-inline-requires#inline-requires\">Performance documentation</a>.</p><h2>View Hermes traces with Chrome</h2><p>Over the last year Facebook has sponsored the <a href=\"https://fellowship.mlh.io/\">Major League Hacking fellowship</a>, supporting contributions to React Native. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessie_anh_ng\">Jessie Nguyen</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/saphalinsaan\">Saphal Patro</a> added the ability to use the Performance tab on Chrome DevTools to visualize the execution of your application when it is using Hermes.</p><p>For more information, check out the <a href=\"/docs/profile-hermes#record-a-hermes-sampling-profile\">new documentation page</a>.</p><h2>Hermes with Proxy Support</h2><p>We have added Proxy support to Hermes, enabling compatibility with popular community projects like react-native-firebase and mobx. If you have been using these packages you can now migrate to Hermes for your project.</p><p>We plan to make Hermes the default JavaScript engine for Android in a coming release so we are working to resolve the remaining issues people have when using Hermes. Please open an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hermes\">Hermes GitHub repo</a> if there are remaining issues holding back your app from adopting Hermes.</p><h2>React 17</h2><p>React 17 does not include new developer-facing features or major breaking changes. For React Native applications, the main change is a <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">new JSX transform</a> enabling files to no longer need to import React to be able to use JSX.</p><p>More information about React 17 is available <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html\">on the React blog</a>.</p><h2>Major Dependency Version Changes</h2><ul><li>Dropped Android API levels 16-20. The Facebook app consistently drops support for Android versions with sufficiently low usage. As the Facebook app no longer supports these versions and is React Native\u2019s main testing surface, React Native is dropping support as well.</li><li>Xcode 12 and CocoaPods 1.10 are required</li><li>Minimum Node support bumped from 10 to Node 12</li><li>Flipper bumped to 0.75.1</li></ul><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thank you to the hundreds of contributors that helped make 0.64 possible! The <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0640\">0.64 changelog</a> includes all of the changes included in this release.</p> "

Since May, Facebook has spent that time thoughtfully reviewing and documenting accessibility gaps within React Native. So far the gap analysis has surfaced 90 issues, all of which have been translated to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/projects/15\">Github issues</a>.</p><p>Overall, we found that React Native APIs provide strong support for accessibility. However, we also found many core components do not yet fully utilize platform accessibility APIs and support is missing for some platform specific features.</p><p>The enthusiasm and diversity of contributors have always played a critical role in the development of React Native and these gaps in accessibility are great opportunities for current and new contributors. If you have been interested in contributing to React Native, we encourage you to join us in making React Native more accessible.</p><p>To recognize contributors for their effort, when an accessibility issue is closed and attached to a pull request, contributors will get a shout out on Twitter from our community manager. Contributors whose pull requests are accepted into the codebase will be highlighted in our monthly issues update on the React Native blog.</p><p>Please join us in making React Native more accessible for everyone.</p><h3>How you can help:</h3><ul><li><p>New contributors should read the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribution guide</a> and browse the list of 46 <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22+label%3AAccessibility\">good first issues</a> in the React Native Github.</p></li><li><p>Contributors interested in issues requiring a bit more effort should visit <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/projects/15\">the project page for Improved React Native Accessibility</a> to see the Github issues that need their knowledge of React Native.</p></li><li><p>Technical writers interested in updating React Native&#x27;s documentation to reflect the accessibility gaps being closed should visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website#-overview\">React Native Docs</a>.</p></li><li><p>Share this initiative with anyone who may be able to help!</p></li><li><p>Follow the GAAD Pledge Open Source Accessibility Community Manager for React Native on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexmarlette\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/React-Native-Open-Source-Accessibility-Community-Manager-102732258549941\">Facebook</a> to keep up to date on progress.</p></li></ul> "

            "#cdata-section2": " ore transparent about what drives us, how we make decisions, and how we focus our efforts.</p><h2><strong>Native Experience</strong></h2><p>Our top priority for React Native is to <strong>match the expectations people have for each platform</strong>. This is why React Native renders to platform primitives. We value native look-and-feel over cross-platform consistency.</p><p>For example, the TextInput in React Native renders to a UITextField on iOS. This ensures that integration with password managers and keyboard controls work out of the box. By using platform primitives, React Native apps are also able to stay up-to-date with design and behavior changes from new releases of Android and iOS.</p><p>In order to match the look-and-feel of native apps, we must also match their performance. This is where we focus our most ambitious efforts. For example, Facebook created Hermes, <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/07/17/hermes\">a new JavaScript Engine built from scratch for React Native on Android</a>. Hermes significantly improves the start time of React Native apps. We are also working on major architectural changes that optimize the threading model and make React Native easier to interoperate with native code.</p><h2>Massive Scale</h2><p>Hundreds of screens in the Facebook app are implemented with React Native. The Facebook app is used by billions of people on a huge range of devices. <strong>This is why</strong> <strong>we invest in the most challenging problems at scale.</strong></p><p>Deploying React Native in our apps lets us identify problems that we wouldn\u2019t see at a smaller scale. For example, Facebook focuses on improving performance across a broad spectrum of devices from the newest iPhone to many older generations of Android devices. This focus informs our architecture projects such as Hermes, Fabric, and TurboModules.</p><p>We have proven that React Native can scale to massive organizations too. When hundreds of developers are working on the same app, gradual adoption is a must. This is why we made sure that React Native can be adopted one screen at a time. Soon, we will be taking this one step further and enable migrating individual native views of an existing native screen to React Native.</p><p>A focus on massive scale means there are many things our team isn\u2019t currently working on. For example, our team doesn\u2019t drive the adoption of React Native in the industry. We also do not actively build solutions for problems that we don\u2019t see at scale. We are proud that we have <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/ECOSYSTEM.md\">many partners and core contributors</a> that are able to focus on those important areas for the community.</p><h2>Developer Velocity</h2><p>Great user experiences are created iteratively. <strong>It should only take a few seconds to seeing the result of code changes</strong> in a running app. React Native&#x27;s architecture enables it to provide near-instant feedback during development.</p><p>We often hear from teams that adopting React Native significantly improved their development velocity. These teams find that the instant feedback during development makes it much easier to try different ideas and add extra polish when they don\u2019t have to interrupt their coding session for every little change. When we make changes to React Native, we make sure to preserve this quality of the developer experience.</p><p>Instant feedback is not the only way that React Native improves developer velocity. Teams can leverage the fast-growing ecosystem of high quality open source packages. Teams can also share business logic between Android, iOS, and the web. This helps them ship updates faster and reduce organizational silos between platform teams.</p><h2>Every Platform</h2><p>When we introduced React Native in 2014, we presented it with our motto \u201CLearn once, write anywhere\u201D \u2014 and we mean <em>anywhere</em>. <strong>Developers should be able to reach as many people as possible without being limited by device model or operating system.</strong></p><p>React Native targets very different platforms including mobile, desktop, web, TV, VR, game consoles, and more. We want to enable rich experiences on each platform instead of requiring developers to build for the lowest common denominator. To accomplish this, we focus on supporting the unique features of each platform. This ranges from varying input mechanisms (e.g. touch, pen, mouse) to fundamentally different consumption experiences like 3D environments in VR.</p><p>This principle informed our decision to implement React Native\u2019s new core architecture in cross-platform C++ to promote parity across platforms. We are also refining the public interface targeted at other platform maintainers like Microsoft with Windows and macOS. We strive to enable any platforms to support React Native.</p><h2>Declarative UI</h2><p>We don\u2019t believe in deploying the exact same user interface on every platform, we believe in <strong>exposing each platform\u2019s unique capabilities with the same declarative programming model</strong>. Our declarative programming model is React.</p><p>In our experience, the unidirectional data flow popularized by React makes applications easier to understand. We prefer to express a screen as a composition of declarative components rather than imperatively managed views. React\u2019s success on the web and the direction of the new native Android and iOS frameworks show that the industry has also embraced declarative UI.</p><p>React popularized declarative user interfaces. However, there remain many unsolved problems that React is uniquely positioned to solve. React Native will continue to build on top of the innovations of React and remain at the forefront of the declarative user interface movement.</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>Today we\u2019re releasing React Native 0.63 that ships with LogBox turned on by default.</p><h2>LogBox</h2><p>We\u2019ve heard frequent feedback from the community that errors and warnings are difficult to debug in React Native. To address these issues we took a look at the entire error, warning, and log system in React Native and redesigned it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8brBH5O-bQ&feature=youtu.be\">from the ground up</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/0.63-logbox.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of LogBox\"/></p><p>LogBox is a completely redesigned redbox, yellowbox, and logging experience in React Native. In 0.62 we introduced LogBox as an opt-in. In this release, we\u2019re launching LogBox as the default experience in all of React Native.</p><p>LogBox addresses complaints that errors and warnings were too verbose, poorly formatted, or unactionable by focusing on three primary goals:</p><ul><li><strong>Concise</strong>: Logs should provide the minimum amount of information necessary to debug an issue.</li><li><strong>Formatted</strong>: Logs should be formatted so that you can quickly find the information you need.</li><li><strong>Actionable</strong>: Logs should be actionable, so you can fix the issue and move on.</li></ul><p>To achieve these goals, LogBox includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Log notifications</strong>: We\u2019ve redesigned the warning notifications and added support for errors so that all console.warn and console.log messages show up as notifications instead of covering your app.</li><li><strong>Code Frames</strong>: Every error and warning now includes a code frame that shows the source code of the log right inside the app, allowing you to quickly identify the source of your issue.</li><li><strong>Component Stacks</strong>: All component stacks are now stripped from error messages and put into their own section with the top three frames visible. This gives you a single, consistent space to expect stack frame information that doesn\u2019t clutter the log message.</li><li><strong>Stack Frame Collapsing</strong>: By default we now collapse call stack frames not related to your application\u2019s code so you can quickly see the issue in your app and not sift through React Native internals.</li><li><strong>Syntax Error Formatting</strong>: We\u2019ve improved the formatting for syntax errors and added codeframes with syntax highlighting so you can see the source of the error, fix it, and continue coding without React Native getting in your way.</li></ul><p>We\u2019ve wrapped all of these features into an improved visual design that\u2019s consistent between errors and warnings and allows paginating through all logs in one enjoyable UI.</p><p>With this change we\u2019re also deprecating YellowBox in favor of LogBox APIs:</p><ul><li><code>LogBox.ignoreLogs()</code>: This function replaces <code>YellowBox.ignoreLogs([])</code> as a way to silence any logs that match the given strings or regexes.</li><li><code>LogBox.ignoreAllLogs()</code>: This function replaces <code>console.disableYellowBox</code> as a way to turn off error or warning notifications. Note: this only disables notifications, uncaught errors will still open a full screen LogBox.</li></ul><p>In 0.63, we will warn when using these deprecated modules or methods. Please update your call sites off of these APIs before they are removed in 0.64.</p><p>For more information on LogBox and debugging react native, see the docs <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#in-app-errors-and-warnings\">here</a>.</p><h2>Pressable</h2><p>React Native is built to enable applications to meet user\u2019s expectations of the platform. This includes avoiding \u201Ctells\u201D\u2014little things that give away that the experience was built with React Native. One major source of these tells has been the Touchable components: <code>Button</code>, <code>TouchableWithoutFeedback</code>, <code>TouchableHighlight</code>, <code>TouchableOpacity</code>, <code>TouchableNativeFeedback</code>, and <code>TouchableBounce</code>. These components make your application interactive by allowing you to provide visual feedback to user interactions. However, because they include built-in styles and effects that don\u2019t match the platform interaction, users can tell when experiences are written with React Native.</p><p>Further, as React Native has grown and our bar for high-quality applications has gone up, these components haven&#x27;t grown with it. React Native now supports platforms like Web, Desktop, and TV, but support for additional input modalities has been lacking. React Native needs to support high-quality interaction experiences on all platforms.</p><p>To address these problems, we are shipping a new core component called <code>Pressable</code>. This component can be used to detect various types of interactions. The API was designed to provide direct access to the current state of interaction without having to maintain state manually in a parent component. It was also designed to enable platforms to extend it&#x27;s capabilities to include hover, blur, focus, and more. We expect that most people will build and share components utilizing <code>Pressable</code> under the hood instead of relying on the default experience of something like <code>TouchableOpacity</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { Pressable, Text } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; <Pressable onPress={() => { console.log(&#x27;pressed&#x27;); }} style={({ pressed }) => ({ backgroundColor: pressed ? &#x27;lightskyblue&#x27; : &#x27;white&#x27; })}> <Text style={styles.text}>Press Me!</Text> </Pressable>; </code></pre><p class=\"snippet-caption\">A simple example of a Pressable component in action</p><p>You can learn more about it from <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable\">the documentation</a>.</p><h2>Native Colors (PlatformColor, DynamicColorIOS)</h2><p>Every native platform has the concept of system-defined colors. Colors that automatically respond to system theme settings such as Light or Dark mode, accessibility settings such as a High Contrast mode, and even its context within the app such as the traits of a containing view or window.</p><p>While it is possible to detect some of these settings via the <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/appearance#getcolorscheme\"><code>Appearance</code></a> API and/or <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#isgrayscaleenabled\"><code>AccessibilityInfo</code></a> and set your styles accordingly, such abstractions are not only costly to develop but are approximating the appearance of native colors. These inconsistencies are particularly noticeable when working on a hybrid application, where React Native elements co-exist next to the native ones.</p><p>React Native now provides an out-of-the-box solution to use these system colors. <code>PlatformColor()</code> is a new API that can be used like any other color in React Native.</p><p>For example, on iOS, the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/ui_element_colors?language=objc\">system provides a color called <code>labelColor</code></a>. That can be used in React Native with <code>PlatformColor</code> like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { Text, PlatformColor } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; <Text style={{ color: PlatformColor(&#x27;labelColor&#x27;) }}> This is a label </Text>; </code></pre><p class=\"snippet-caption\">Sets the color of the Text component to labelColor as defined by iOS.</p><p>Android, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#colorButtonNormal\">provides colors like colorButtonNormal</a>. You can use this color in React Native with:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { View, Text, PlatformColor } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; <View style={{ backgroundColor: PlatformColor(&#x27;?attr/colorButtonNormal&#x27;) }}> <Text>This is colored like a button!</Text> </View>; </code></pre><p class=\"snippet-caption\">Sets the background color of the View component to colorButtonNormal as defined by Android.</p><p>You can learn more about <code>PlatformColor</code> from <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/platformcolor\">the documentation</a>. You can also check the actual <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/PlatformColor/PlatformColorExample.js\">code examples present in the RNTester</a>.</p><p><code>DynamicColorIOS</code> is an iOS only API that lets you define which color to use in light and dark mode. Similar to <code>PlatformColor</code>, this can be used anywhere you can use colors. <code>DynamicColorIOS</code> uses iOS\u2019s <code>colorWithDynamicProvider</code> under the hood.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { Text, DynamicColorIOS } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; const customDynamicTextColor = DynamicColorIOS({ dark: &#x27;lightskyblue&#x27;, light: &#x27;midnightblue&#x27; }); <Text style={{ color: customDynamicTextColor }}> This color changes automatically based on the system theme! </Text>; </code></pre><p class=\"snippet-caption\">Changes the text color based on the system theme</p><p>You can learn more about <code>DynamicColorIOS</code> from <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/dynamiccolorios\">the documentation</a>.</p><h2>Dropping iOS 9 and Node.js 8 support</h2><p>After over four years from its release, we are dropping support for iOS 9. This change will allow us to move faster by being able to reduce the number of compatibility checks that need to be placed in the native code to detect whether a given feature was supported on a certain iOS version. With its <a href=\"https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/\">market share of 1%</a>, it shouldn\u2019t have much negative impact on your customers.</p><p>At the same time, we are dropping support for Node 8. <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/fr/blog/release/v8.9.0/\">Its LTS maintenance cycle expired in December 2019</a>. The current LTS is Node 10 and it is now the version that we are targeting. If you are still using Node 8 for the development of React Native applications, we encourage you to upgrade in order to receive all the latest security fixes and updates.</p><h2>Other notable improvements</h2><ul><li><strong>Support rendering <code><View /></code> in <code><Text /></code> without explicit size</strong>: You can now render any <code><View /></code> inside any <code><Text /></code> component without setting its width and height explicitly, which wasn\u2019t always possible. On previous releases of React Native, this would result in a RedBox.</li><li><strong>Changed iOS LaunchScreen from <code>xib</code> to <code>storyboard</code></strong>: Starting April 30, 2020, all apps submitted to the App Store must use an Xcode storyboard to provide the app\u2019s launch screen and all iPhone apps must support all iPhone screens. This commit adjusts the default React Native template to be compatible with this requirement.</li></ul><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thank you to the hundreds of contributors that helped make 0.63 possible!</p><blockquote><p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii\">Rick Hanlon</a> for authoring the section on <code>LogBox</code> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eli_White\">Eli White</a> for authoring the <code>Pressable</code> part of this article.</p></blockquote><p>To see all the updates, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0630\">0.63 changelog</a>.</p> "

We\u2019re releasing this version today to respect the work of hundreds of contributors who made this release possible and to prevent the release from falling too far behind master. Please be mindful of the reduced capacity of contributors to help with issues and prepare to delay upgrading if necessary.</p><h2>Flipper by default</h2><p><a href=\"https://fbflipper.com/\">Flipper</a> is a developer tool for debugging mobile apps. It\u2019s popular in the Android and iOS communities, and in this release we\u2019ve enabled support by default for new and existing React Native apps.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/0.62-flipper.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Flipper for React Native\"/></p><p>Flipper provides the following features out of the box:</p><ul><li><strong>Metro Actions</strong>: Reload the app and trigger the Dev Menu right from the toolbar.</li><li><strong>Crash Reporter</strong>: View crash reports from Android and iOS devices.</li><li><strong>React DevTools</strong>: Use the newest version of React DevTools right alongside all your other tools.</li><li><strong>Network Inspector</strong>: View all of the network requests made by device applications.</li><li><strong>Metro and Device Logs</strong>: View, search, and filter all logs from both Metro and the Device.</li><li><strong>Native Layout Inspector</strong>: View and edit the native layout output by the React Native renderer.</li><li><strong>Database and Preference Inspectors</strong>: View and edit the device databases and preferences.</li></ul><p>Additionally, since Flipper is an extensible platform, it provides a marketplace that pulls plugins from NPM so you can publish and install custom plugins specific to your workflows. See the available plugins <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=flipper-plugin\">here</a>.</p><p>For more information, check out the <a href=\"https://fbflipper.com/docs/features/react-native\">Flipper documentation</a>.</p><h2>New dark mode features</h2><p>We\u2019ve added a new <code>Appearance</code> module to provide access to the user&#x27;s appearance preferences, such as their preferred color scheme (light or dark).</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">const colorScheme = Appearance.getColorScheme(); if (colorScheme === &#x27;dark&#x27;) { // Use dark color scheme } </code></pre><p>We\u2019ve also added a hook to subscribe to state updates to the users preferences:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { Text, useColorScheme } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; const MyComponent = () => { const colorScheme = useColorScheme(); return <Text>useColorScheme(): {colorScheme}</Text>; }; </code></pre><p>See the docs for <a href=\"/docs/appearance\">Appearance</a> and <a href=\"/docs/usecolorscheme\">useColorScheme</a> for more information.</p><h2>Moving Apple TV to react-native-tvos</h2><p>As part of our <a href=\"/blog/#lean-core\">Lean Core effort</a> and to bring Apple TV in line with other platforms like React Native Windows and React Native macOS, we\u2019ve started to remove Apple TV specific code from core.</p><p>Going forward, Apple TV support for React Native will be maintained in <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tvos\">react-native-community/react-native-tvos</a> along with the corresponding <code>react-native-tvos</code> NPM package. This is a full fork of the main repository, with only the changes needed to support Apple TV.</p><p>Releases of <code>react-native-tvos</code> will be based on the public release of React Native. For this 0.62 release of <code>react-native</code> please upgrade Apple TV projects to use <code>react-native-tvos</code> 0.62.</p><h2>More upgrade support</h2><p>When 0.61 was released, the community introduced a new <a href=\"https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/\">upgrade helper</a> tool to support developers upgrading to new versions of React Native. The upgrade helper provides a diff of changes from the version you&#x27;re on to the version you&#x27;re targeting, allowing you to see the changes that need to be made for your specific upgrade.</p><p>Even with this tool, issues come up when upgrading. Today we&#x27;re introducing more dedicated upgrading support by announcing <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-support\">Upgrade-Support</a>. Upgrade Support is a GitHub issue tracker where users can submit issues specific to upgrading their projects to receive help from the community.</p><p>We&#x27;re always working to improve the upgrade experience, and we hope that these tools give users the support they need in the edge cases we haven&#x27;t covered yet.</p><h2>Other improvements</h2><ul><li><strong>LogBox</strong>: We\u2019re adding the new LogBox error and warning experience as an opt-in; to enable it, add <code>require(&#x27;react-native&#x27;).unstable_enableLogBox()</code> to your <code>index.js</code> file.</li><li><strong>React DevTools v4</strong>: This change includes an upgrade to the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html\">latest React DevTools</a> which offers significant performance gains, an improved navigation experience, and full support for React Hooks.</li><li><strong>Accessibility improvements</strong>: We\u2019ve made improvements to accessibility including adding <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityvalue-ios-android\">accessibilityValue</a>, missing props on <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8c0c860e38f57e18296f689e47dfb4a54088c260\">Touchables</a>, <code>onSlidingComplete</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c7aa6dc8270c0eabc913fe6c617c8131e3f4b3c5\">accessibility events</a>, and changing the default role of Switch component from <code>\"button\"</code> to <code>\"switch\"</code>.</li></ul><h2>Breaking changes</h2><ul><li><strong>Remove PropTypes</strong>: We&#x27;re removing <code>propTypes</code> from core components in order to reduce the app size impact of React Native core and to favor static type systems which check at compile time instead of runtime.</li><li><strong>Remove accessibilityStates</strong>: We\u2019ve <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7b35f427fd66cb0f36921b992095fe5b3c14d8b9\">removed</a> the deprecated <code>accessibilityStates</code> property in favor of the new <code>accessibilityState</code> prop which is a more semantically rich way for components to describe information about their state to accessibility services.</li><li><strong>TextInput changes</strong>: We removed <code>onTextInput</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3f7e0a2c9601fc186f25bfd794cd0008ac3983ab\">from TextInput</a> as it\u2019s uncommon, not W3C compliant, and difficult to implement in <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4\">Fabric</a>.

            "#cdata-section": " <p>We\u2019re excited to announce React Native 0.61, which includes a new reloading experience we\u2019re calling Fast Refresh.</p><h2>Fast Refresh</h2><p>When we asked the React Native community about <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64\">common pain points</a>, one of the top answers was that the \u201Chot reloading\u201D feature was broken. It didn\u2019t work reliably for function components, often failed to update the screen, and wasn\u2019t resilient to typos and mistakes. We heard that most people turned it off because it was too unreliable.</p><p>In React Native 0.61, <strong>we\u2019re unifying the existing \u201Clive reloading\u201D (reload on save) and \u201Chot reloading\u201D features into a single new feature called \u201CFast Refresh\u201D</strong>. Fast Refresh was implemented from scratch with the following principles:</p><ul><li>Fast Refresh <strong>fully supports modern React</strong>, including function components and Hooks.</li><li>Fast Refresh <strong>gracefully recovers after typos</strong> and other mistakes, and falls back to a full reload when needed.</li><li>Fast Refresh <strong>doesn\u2019t perform invasive code transformations</strong> so it\u2019s reliable enough to be on by default.</li></ul><p>To see Fast Refresh in action, check out this video:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><video width=\"700\" controls=\"\" autoplay=\"\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://reactnative.dev/img/homepage/ReactRefresh.mp4\"/></video></p><p>Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you prefer, you can turn it off in the Dev Menu (Cmd+D on iOS, Cmd+M or Ctrl+M on Android). Turning it on and off is instant so you can do it any time.</p><p>Here are a few Fast Refresh tips:</p><ul><li>Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks!) by default.</li><li>If you need to reset the React state on every edit, you can add a special <code>// @refresh reset</code> comment to the file with that component.</li><li>Fast Refresh always remounts class components without preserving state. This ensures it works reliably.</li><li>We all make mistakes in the code! Fast Refresh automatically retries rendering after you save a file. You don&#x27;t need to reload the app manually after fixing a syntax or a runtime error.</li><li>Adding a <code>console.log</code> or a <code>debugger</code> statement during edits is a neat debugging technique.</li></ul><p>Please report any issues with Fast Refresh on GitHub, and we\u2019ll look into them.</p><h2>Other Improvements</h2><ul><li><strong>Fixed use_frameworks! CocoaPods support.</strong> In 0.60 we made some updates to integrate CocoaPods by default. Unfortunately, this broke builds using <a href=\"https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#use_frameworks_bang\">use_frameworks!</a>. This is <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/25619\">fixed in 0.61</a>, making it easier to integrate React Native into your iOS projects that require building with dynamic frameworks.</li><li><strong>Add useWindowDimensions Hook.</strong> This new Hook automatically provides and subscribes to dimension updates, and can be used instead of the Dimensions API in most cases.</li><li><strong>React was upgraded to 16.9.</strong> This version deprecates old names for the UNSAFE<!-- -->_<!-- --> lifecycle methods, contains improvements to <code>act</code>, and more. See the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/08/react-v16.9.0.html\">React 16.9 blog post</a> for an automated migration script and more information.</li></ul><h2>Breaking Changes</h2><ul><li><strong>Remove React .xcodeproj.</strong> In 0.60, we introduced auto-linking support via CocoaPods. We have also integrated CocoaPods into the e2e tests runs, so that from now on, we have a unified standard way of integrating RN into iOS apps. This effectively deprecates the React .xcodeproj support, and the file has been removed starting 0.61. Note: if you use 0.60 auto-linking already, you shouldn&#x27;t be affected.</li></ul><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all of the contributors that helped make 0.61 possible!</p><p>To see all the updates, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0610\">0.61 changelog</a>.</p> "

This release handles significant migrations for both Android and iOS platforms, and many issues are resolved too. This blog post covers the highlights of the release. As always though, refer to the changelog for more detailed information. Finally, thank you contributors for helping us to make this milestone!</p><h2>Focus on Accessibility</h2><p>There have been many improvements to the accessibility APIs, like <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cfe0032\">announceForAccessibility</a>, plus improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1aeac1c\">roles</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/14b4668\">action support</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0090ab3\">flags</a>, and more. Accessibility is a complex science, but we hope these improvements make it a bit easier to be an A11Y. Be sure to check <a href=\"/blog/2019/06/12/react-native-open-source-update#meaningful-community-contributions\">React Native Open Source Update June 2019</a> for more details of these changes.</p><h2>A Fresh Start</h2><p>React Native&#x27;s start screen has been updated! Thank you to the many contributors who helped create the new UI. This new \"Hello World\" will welcome users to the ecosystem in a more friendly, engaging way.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/0.60-new-init-screen.png\" alt=\"The new init screen helps developers get started from the get-go with resources and a good example\"/></p><h2>AndroidX Support</h2><p><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx\">AndroidX</a> is a major step forward in the Android ecosystem, and the old support library artifacts are being deprecated. For 0.60, React Native has been migrated over to AndroidX. This is a breaking change, and <strong>your native code and dependencies will need to be migrated</strong> as well.</p><blockquote><p>With this change, React Native apps will need to begin using AndroidX themselves. They cannot be used side-by-side in one app, so all of the app code and dependency code needs to be using one or the other.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/matt-oakes\">matt-oakes</a> on <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/129\">discussions-and-proposals</a></p></blockquote><p>While your own native code will need to be migrated by you, <a href=\"https://github.com/mikehardy\">@mikehardy</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cawfree\">@cawfree</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/m4tt72\">@m4tt72</a> built a <a href=\"https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier\">clever tool named \"jetifier\"</a> to patch your <code>node_modules</code>. Library maintainers will need to upgrade, but this tool provide you with a temporary solution while giving them time to release an AndroidX version. So if you find errors related to AndroidX migration, give this a shot.</p><h2>CocoaPods by Default</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0004-cocoapods-support-improvements.md\">CocoaPods are now part of React Native&#x27;s iOS project</a>. If you weren&#x27;t already, be sure to open iOS platform code using the <code>xcworkspace</code> file from now on (protip: try <code>xed ios</code> from the root project directory). Also, the <code>podspec</code>s for the internal packages have changed to make them compatible with the Xcode projects, which will help with troubleshooting and debugging. Expect to make <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2321b3f\">some straightforward changes</a> to your <code>Podfile</code> as part of the upgrade to 0.60 to bring this exciting support. Note that we are aware of a compatibility issue with <code>use_frameworks!</code>, and we&#x27;re tracking an <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25349\">issue</a> with workarounds and a future patch.</p><h2>Lean Core Removals</h2><p><strong>WebView</strong> and <strong>NetInfo</strong> were previously extracted into separate repositories, and in 0.60 we\u2019ve finished migrating them out of the React Native repository. Additionally, in response to community feedback about new App Store policy, <strong>Geolocation</strong> has been extracted. If you haven\u2019t already, complete your migration by adding dependencies to <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview\">react-native-webview</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo\">@react-native-community/netinfo</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation\">@react-native-community/geolocation</a>. If you&#x27;d like an automated solution, consider using <a href=\"https://github.com/lucasbento/rn-update-deprecated-modules\">rn-upgrade-deprecated-modules</a>. Maintainers have made more than 100 commits to these repositories since extraction and we\u2019re excited to see the community\u2019s support!</p><h2>Native Modules are now Autolinked</h2><p>The team working on the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli\">React Native CLI</a> has introduced major improvements to native module linking called <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md\">autolinking</a>! Most scenarios will not require the use of <code>react-native link</code> anymore. At the same time, the team overhauled the linking process in general. Be sure to <code>react-native unlink</code> any preexisting dependencies as mentioned in the docs above.</p><h2>Upgrade Helper</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/lucasbento\">@lucasbento</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pvinis\">@pvinis</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kelset\">@kelset</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/watadarkstar\">@watadarkstar</a> have built a great tool called <a href=\"https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/\">Upgrade Helper</a> to make the upgrade process simpler. It helps React Native users with brownfield apps or complex customizations to see what&#x27;s changed between versions. Take a look at the <a href=\"/docs/upgrading\">updated upgrading docs</a> and try it out today for your upgrade path!</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/0.60-upgrade-helper.png\" alt=\"Upgrade Helper cleanly and easily shows the changes needed to migrate to a different version of React Native\"/></p><h2>A Note to Library Maintainers</h2><p>Changes for AndroidX will almost certainly require updates to your library, so be sure to include support soon. If you&#x27;re not able to upgrade yet, consider checking your library against the jetifier to confirm that users are able to patch your library at build time.</p><p>Review the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md\">autolinking</a> docs to update your configs and readme. Depending on how your library was previously integrated, you may also need to make some additional changes. Check the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/dependencies.md\">dependencies</a> guide from the CLI for information on how to define your dependency interface.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>While these are the highlights that we noted, there are many others to be excited about. To see all the updates, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a>. As always, stay tuned for more news.

This screen is what most people see when they are first using React Native. It now links first time users to the documentation and the look fits with our upcoming website redesign ð. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/orta\">Orta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashurson/\">Adam Shurson</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/glauberfc\">Glauber Castro</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/karanpratapsingh\">Karan Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_eliperkins\">Eli Perkins</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lbentosilva\">Lucas Bento</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericlewis\">Eric Lewis</a> for all their work and collaboration!<ul><li>Check out the new app screen on the \u201C<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlAqMZxveg\">React Native Show</a>\u201C </em>video series.</li></ul></li><li><strong>TurboModule Types:</strong> The new <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40\">TurboModules system</a> requires <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24875\">types for all native modules</a> to guarantee type safe operations in native. In just over two weeks, the community sent ~40 Pull Requests to complete this work for flow typed native modules. Aside from the people already mentioned above, we\u2019d like to thank <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michalchudziak\">MichaÅ Chudziak</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thymikee\">MichaÅ PierzchaÅa</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/wojteg1337\">Wojtek Szafraniec</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/jeanregisser\">Jean Regisser</a> and everyone else who sent one or more Pull Requests.</li><li><strong>Haste:</strong> Since 2015 React Native used the <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/0629e3e2289ed54fac854472aec9a5f6c8318c98#diff-c42b758729cb89976b3a8fd51d1227fa\">\u201Chaste\u201D module system</a> that allows importing modules just via a global id instead of a relative path which is convenient but not well supported by many tools. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JI\">James Ide</a> proposed removing haste, similar to how React removed haste many years ago. He planned all the work through an <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24316\">umbrella task</a> and he sent 18 Pull Requests to make it happen! Check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JI/status/1136369775083319296\">his Twitter thread</a> to learn more.</li><li><strong>Android Fragments:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/jpshelley\">John Shelley</a>\u2018s proposal to make React Native work via <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/12199\">Android Fragments</a> was merged and will be available in 0.61. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments\">Read more about Android Fragments here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Lean Core</h3><p>The primary motivation of <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6\">Lean Core</a> has been to split modules out of React Native into separate repositories so they can receive better maintenance. In just a six months repositories like <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview\">WebView</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo\">NetInfo</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage\">AsyncStorage</a>, the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website\">website</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli\">CLI</a> received more than 800 Pull Requests combined. Besides better maintenance, these projects can also be independently released more often than React Native itself.</p><p>We have also taken the opportunity to remove obsolete polyfills and legacy components from React Native itself. Polyfills were necessary in the past to support language features like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map\"><code>Map</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set\"><code>Set</code></a> in older versions of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Now that React Native ships with a new version, these polyfills were removed.</p><p>This work is still in progress and many more things still need to be split out or removed both on the native and JavaScript side but there are early signs that we managed to reverse the trend of increasing the surface area and app size: When looking at the JavaScript bundle for example, about a year ago in version 0.54 the React Native JavaScript bundle size was 530kb and grew to 607kb (+77kb) by version 0.57 in just 6 months. Now we are seeing a bundle size reduction of 28kb down to 579kb on master, a delta of more than 100kb!</p><p>As we conclude the first iteration of the Lean Core effort, we will make an effort to be more intentional about new APIs added to React Native and we will continuously evaluate ways to make React Native smaller and faster, as well as finding ways to empower the community to take ownership of various components.</p><h2>User Feedback</h2><p>Six months ago we asked the community \u201C<a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64\">What do you dislike about React Native?</a>\u201D which gave a good overview of problems people are facing. We <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104\">replied to the post a few months ago</a> and it&#x27;s time to summarize the progress that was made on top issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Upgrading:</strong> The React Native community rallied around with multiple improvements to the upgrading experience: <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md\">autolinking</a>, a better upgrading command via <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge\">rn-diff-purge</a>, an upgrade helper website (coming soon). We\u2019ll also make sure to communicate breaking changes and exciting new features by publishing blog posts for each major release. Many of these improvements will make future upgrades beyond the 0.60 release significantly easier.</li><li><strong>Support / Uncertainty:</strong> Many people were frustrated with the lack of activity on Pull Requests and general uncertainty about Facebook&#x27;s investment in React Native. As we&#x27;ve shown above, we can confidently say that we are ready for many more Pull Requests and we are eagerly looking forward to your proposals and contributions!</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> React Native 0.59 shipped with a new and much faster version of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Separately, we have been working on making it easier to enable <a href=\"/docs/performance#ram-bundles-inline-requires\">inline-requires</a> by default and we have more exciting updates for you in the next couple of months.</li><li><strong>Documentation:</strong> We recently started an effort to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/929\">overhaul and rewrite all of React Native&#x27;s documentation</a>. If you are looking to contribute, we\u2019d love to get your help!</li><li><strong>Warnings in Xcode:</strong> We <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609\">got rid of all the existing warnings</a> and are making an effort not to introduce new warnings.</li><li><strong>Hot Reloading:</strong> The React team is building a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1126948870137753605\">new hot reloading system</a> that will soon be integrated into React Native.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately we weren\u2019t able to improve everything just yet:</p><ul><li><strong>Debugging:</strong> We fixed many inconvenient bugs and issues people that we have been running into every day, but unfortunately we haven&#x27;t made as much progress on this as we would like. We recognize that debugging with React Native isn&#x27;t great and we&#x27;ll prioritize improving this in the future.</li><li><strong>Metro symlinks:</strong> Unfortunately we haven&#x27;t been able to implement a simple and straightforward solution for this yet. However, React Native users <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1\">shared various workarounds</a> that may work for you.</li></ul><p>Given the large amount of changes in the past six months, we&#x27;d like to ask you the same question again. If you are using the latest version of React Native and you have things you&#x27;d like to give feedback on, please comment on our new edition of <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/134\">\u201CWhat do you dislike about React Native?\u201D</a></p><h2>Continuous Integration</h2><p>Facebook merges all Pull Requests and internal changes directly into Facebook\u2019s repository first and then syncs all commits back to GitHub. Facebook\u2019s infrastructure is different from common continuous integration services and not all open source tests were run inside of Facebook. This means that commits that sync out to GitHub frequently break tests in open source which take a lot of time to fix.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hectorramos\">HÃ©ctor Ramos</a> from the React Native team spent the past two months improving React Native&#x27;s continuous integration systems both at Facebook and on GitHub. Most of the open source tests are now run before changes are committed to React Native at Facebook which will keep CI stable on GitHub when commits are being synchronized.</p><h2>Next</h2><p>Make sure to check out our talks about the future of React Native! In the next couple of months, members of the React Native team at Facebook will speak at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf\">Chain React</a> and at <a href=\"https://react-native.eu/\">React Native EU</a>. Also, watch out for our next release, 0.60, which is right around the corner. <em>It&#x27;s going to be exciting</em> â¨</p> "

We collaborated with the Marketplace team to improve quality and add delight to the product. At this point, Marketplace is one of the highest quality products in the Facebook app both on Android and iOS.</li><li>Marketplace&#x27;s performance was a big challenge as well, especially on mid-end Android devices. We cut startup time by more than 50% over the last year with more improvements on the way! The biggest improvements are being built into React Native and will be coming to the community later this year.</li><li>We have the confidence that we can build the high quality and performant apps that Facebook needs with React Native. This confidence has let us invest in bigger bets, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI&app=desktop\">rethinking the core of React Native</a>.</li><li>Microsoft supports and uses React Native for Windows, enabling people to use their expertise and codebase to render to Microsofts&#x27;s Universal Windows Platform. Check out Microsoft Build next week to <a href=\"https://mybuild.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/77321\">hear them talk about that more</a>.</li></ul><h3>React Radio Podcast about Open Source</h3><p>Eli&#x27;s talk concludes by talking about our recent open source work.

Contributions also come in other forms, so <em>thank you</em> for maintaining issues, fostering communities, and teaching people about React Native. This month brings a number of highly anticipated changes, and we hope you enjoy them.</p><h2>ð£ Hooks are here</h2><p>React Hooks are part of this release, which let you reuse stateful logic across components. There is a lot of buzz about hooks, but if you haven&#x27;t heard, take a look at some of the wonderful resources below:</p><blockquote><ul><li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">Introducing Hooks</a> explains why we\u2019re adding Hooks to React.</li><li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html\">Hooks at a Glance</a> is a fast-paced overview of the built-in Hooks.</li><li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html\">Building Your Own Hooks</a> demonstrates code reuse with custom Hooks.</li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889\">Making Sense of React Hooks</a> explores the new possibilities unlocked by Hooks.</li><li><a href=\"https://usehooks.com/\">useHooks.com</a> showcases community-maintained Hooks recipes and demos.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Be sure to give this a try in your apps. We hope that you find the reuse as exciting as we do.</p><h2>ð± Updated JSC means performance gains and 64-bit support on Android</h2><p>React Native uses JSC (<a href=\"https://webkit.org/\">JavaScriptCore</a>) to power your application. JSC on Android was a few years old, which meant that a lot of modern JavaScript features weren&#x27;t supported. Even worse, it performed poorly compared iOS&#x27;s modern JSC. With this release, that all changes.</p><p>Thanks to some awesome work by <a href=\"https://github.com/danielzlotin\">@DanielZlotin</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dulmandakh\">@dulmandakh</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/gengjiawen\">@gengjiawen</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kmagiera\">@kmagiera</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/kudo\">@kudo</a> JSC has caught up with the past few years. This brings with it 64-bit support, modern JavaScript support, and <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts/tree/master/measure\">big performance improvements</a>. Kudos for also making this a maintainable process now so that we can take advantage of future WebKit improvements without so much legwork, and thank you Software Mansion and Expo for making this work possible.</p><h2>ð¨ Faster app launches with inline requires</h2><p>We want to help people have performant React Native apps by default and are working to bring Facebook&#x27;s optimizations to the community. Applications load resources as needed rather than slowing down launch. This feature is called \"inline requires\", as it lets Metro identify components to be lazy loaded. Apps with a deep and varied component architecture will see the most improvement.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/inline-requires.png\" alt=\"source of the `metro.config.js` file in the 0.59 template, demonstrating where to enable `inlineRequires`\"/></p><p>We need the community to let us know how it works before we turn it on by default. When you upgrade to 0.59, there will be a new <code>metro.config.js</code> file; flip the options to true and give us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inline-requires\">your feedback</a>! Read more about inline requires <a href=\"/docs/performance#inline-requires\">in the performance docs</a> to benchmark your app.</p><h2>ð Lean core is underway</h2><p>React Native is a large and complex project with a complicated repository. This makes the codebase less approachable to contributors, difficult to test, and bloated as a dev dependency. <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6\">Lean Core</a> is our effort to address these issues by migrating code to separate libraries for better management. The past few releases have seen the first steps of this, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMLKb4or8yg\">let&#x27;s get serious</a>.</p><p>You may notice that additional components are now officially deprecated. This is great news, as there are now owners for these features actively maintaining them. Heed the warning messages and migrate to the new libraries for these features, because they will be removed in a future release. Below is a table indicating the component, its status, and where you may migrate your use to.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Deprecated?</th><th>New home</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>AsyncStorage</strong></td><td>0.59</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage\">@react-native-community/react-native-async-storage</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>ImageStore</strong></td><td>0.59</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-file-system\">expo-file-system</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs\">react-native-fs</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>MaskedViewIOS</strong></td><td>0.59</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-masked-view\">@react-native-community/react-native-masked-view</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>NetInfo</strong></td><td>0.59</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo\">@react-native-community/react-native-netinfo</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Slider</strong></td><td>0.59</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-slider\">@react-native-community/react-native-slider</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>ViewPagerAndroid</strong></td><td>0.59</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-viewpager\">@react-native-community/react-native-viewpager</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Over the coming months, there will be many more components following this path to a leaner core. We&#x27;re looking for help with this <!-- -->\u2014<!-- --> head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313\">lean core umbrella</a> to pitch in.</p><h2>ð©ð½\u200Dð» CLI improvements</h2><p>React Native&#x27;s command line tools are developer&#x27;s entry point to the ecosystem, but they had long-standing issues and lacked official support. The CLI tools have been moved to a <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli\">new repository</a>, and a <a href=\"https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6\">dedicated group of maintainers</a> have already made some exciting improvements.</p><p>Logs are formatted much better now. Commands now run nearly instantly <!-- -->\u2014<!-- --> you&#x27;ll immediately notice a difference:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/0.58-cli-speed.png\" alt=\"0.58&#x27;s CLI is slow to start\"/><img src=\"/blog/assets/0.59-cli-speed.png\" alt=\"0.58&#x27;s CLI is nearly instantaneous\"/></p><h2>ð Upgrading to 0.59</h2><p>We heard your feedback regarding the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/68\">React Native upgrade process</a> and we are taking steps to improve the experience in <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64#issuecomment-444775432\">future releases</a>. To upgrade to 0.59, we recommend using <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge\"><code>rn-diff-purge</code></a> to determine what has changed between your current React Native version and 0.59, then applying those changes manually. Once you&#x27;ve upgraded your project to 0.59, you will be able to use the newly improved <code>react-native upgrade</code> command (based on <code>rn-diff-purge</code>!) to upgrade to 0.60 and beyond as newer releases become available.</p><h2>ð¨ Breaking Changes</h2><p>Android support in 0.59 has been cleaned up following Google&#x27;s latest recommendations, which may result in potential breakage of existing apps. This issue might present as a runtime crash and a message, \"You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity\". We recommend updating your project&#x27;s <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file, making sure that the <code>android:theme</code> value is an <code>AppCompat</code> theme (such as <code>@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar</code>).</p><p>The <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> command has been removed in 0.59, in favor of the newly improved <code>react-native upgrade</code> command.</p><h2>ð¤ Thanks</h2><p>Lots of new contributors helped with <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22990\">enabling generation of native code from flow types</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609\">resolving Xcode warnings</a> - these are a great way to learn how React Native works and contributing to the greater good. Thank you! Look out for similar issues in the future.</p><p>While these are the highlights that we noted, there are many others to be excited about. To see all of the updates, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a>. 0.59 is a huge release \u2013 we can&#x27;t wait for you to try it out.</p><p>We have even more improvements coming throughout the rest of the year. Stay tuned!</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/turnrye\">Ryan</a> and the whole <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative\">React Native core team</a></p> "

Our goals were to reduce outstanding pull requests, reduce the project&#x27;s surface area, identify leading user problems, and establish guidelines for community management.</p><p>In the past two months, we made more progress than we expected. Read on for more details:</p><h3>Pull Requests</h3><p>In order to build a healthy community, we must respond quickly to code contributions. In past years, we de-prioritized reviewing community contributions and accumulated 280 pull requests (December 2018). In the first milestone, we reduced the number of open pull requests to ~65. Simultaneously, the average number of pull requests opened per day increased from 3.5 to 7 which means we have handled about <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?page=24&q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01&utf8=%E2%9C%93\">600 pull requests</a> in the last three months.</p><p>We merged <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01+label%3A%22Merged%22+\">almost two-thirds</a> and closed one-third of the pull requests. They were closed without being merged if they are obsolete or low quality, or if they unnecessarily increase the project&#x27;s surface area. Most of the merged pull requests fixed bugs, improved cross-platform parity, or introduced new features. Notable contributions include improving type safety and the ongoing work to support AndroidX.</p><p>At Facebook, we run React Native from master, so we test all changes first before they make it into a React Native Release. Out of all the merged pull requests, only six caused issues: four only affected internal development and two were caught in the release candidate state.</p><p>One of the more visible community contributions was <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/22242\">the updated \u201CRedBox\u201D screen</a>. It&#x27;s a good example of how the community is making the developer experience friendlier.</p><h3>Lean Core</h3><p>React Native currently has a very wide surface area with many unmaintained abstractions that we do not use a lot at Facebook. We are working on reducing the surface area in order to make React Native smaller and allow the community to take better care of abstractions that are mostly unused at Facebook.</p><p>In the first milestone, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1093171521114247171\">we asked the community for help on the Lean Core project</a>. The response was overwhelming and we could barely keep up with all the progress. <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313\">Check out all the work completed in less than a month</a>!</p><p>What we are most excited about is that maintainers have jumped in fixing long standing issues, adding tests, and supporting long requested features. These modules are getting more support than they ever did within React Native, showing that this is a great step for the community. Examples of such projects are <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview\">WebView</a> that has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/titozzz/status/1101283928026034176\">received many pull requests</a> since their extraction and the CLI that is now <a href=\"https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6\">maintained by members of the community</a> and received much needed improvements and fixes.</p><h3>Leading User Problems</h3><p>In December, we asked the community what they <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64\">disliked about React Native</a>. We aggregated the responses and <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104\">replied to each and every problem</a>. Fortunately, many of the issues that our community faces are also problems at Facebook. In our next milestone, we plan to address some of the main problems.</p><p>One of the highest voted problems was the developer experience of upgrading to newer versions of React Native. Unfortunately, this is not something that we experience ourselves because we run React Native from master. Thankfully, members from the community already stepped up to address this problem:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/thymikee\">MichaÅ PierzchaÅa</a> from Callstack <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli/pull/176/files\">improved react-native upgrade</a> by using <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge\">rn-diff-purge</a> under the hood. We also updated the website to remove outdated upgrade instructions.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23563\">We plan on recommending CocoaPods by default for iOS projects</a> which will reduce churn in project files when upgrading React Native. This will make it easier for people to install and link third-party modules which is even more important in the context of Lean Core as we expect projects to link more modules by default.</li></ul><h3>0.59 Release</h3><p>Without the help of the React Native community, especially <a href=\"https://github.com/grabbou\">Mike Grabowski</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kelset\">Lorenzo Sciandra</a>, we would not be able to ship releases. We want to improve the release management process and plan to be more involved from now on:</p><ul><li>We will work with community members to create a blog post for each major release.</li><li>We will show breaking changes directly in the CLI when people upgrade to new versions.</li><li>We will reduce the time it takes to make a release. We are exploring ways to increase automated testing and also creating an improved manual test plan.</li></ul><p>Many of these plans will be incorporated in the upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.59.0-rc.3\">React Native 0.59 release</a>. 0.59 will ship with React Hooks, a new 64-bit version of JavaScriptCore for Android, and many performance and functionality improvements. It is currently published as a release candidate and is expected to be stable within the next two weeks.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>For the next two months, we will continue managing pull requests <a href=\"https://k03lwm00zo.codesandbox.io/\">to stay on track</a> while also starting to reduce the number of outstanding GitHub issues. We will continue reducing the surface area of React Native through the Lean Core project. We plan to address 5 of the top community problems. As we finalize the community guidelines, we will turn attention to our website and documentation.</p><p>We are very excited to host over ten contributors from our community at Facebook London in March to help drive several of these efforts. We are glad that you are using React Native and hope that you&#x27;ll see and feel the improvements we are working on in 2019. We&#x27;ll be back with another update in a few months and <em>will be merging your pull requests in the meantime!</em> âï¸âï¸</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>In 2018 the React Native Community made a number of changes to the way we develop and communicate about React Native. We believe that a few years from now we will look back and see that this shift was a turning point for React Native.</p><p>A lot of people are excited about the rewrite of React Native&#x27;s architecture, widely known as <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4\">Fabric</a>. Among other things, this will fix fundamental limitations in React Native&#x27;s architecture and will set up React Native for success in the future together with <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40\">JSI and TurboModules</a>.</p><p>The biggest shift in 2018 was to empower the React Native Community. From the beginning, Facebook encouraged developers from all around the world to participate in React Native&#x27;s open source project. Since then, a number of core contributors emerged to handle, among other things, the release process.</p><p>These members took a few substantial steps towards making the whole community more empowered to shape the future of this project with the following resources:</p><h2><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases\"><code>react-native-releases</code></a> ð¬</h2><p>This repository, created in January, serves the dual purpose of allowing everyone to keep up the new releases in a more collaborative manner and opened the conversation of what would be part of a certain release to whomever wanted to suggest a cherry-pick (like for <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/71\">0.57.8</a> and all its previous versions).</p><p>This has been the driving force behind moving away from a monthly release cycle, and the \"long term support\" approach currently used for version 0.57.x.</p><p>Half of the credit for reaching these decisions goes to the other repository created this year:</p><h2><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals\"><code>discussions-and-proposals</code></a> ð£</h2><p>This repository, created in July, expanded on the idea of a more open environment for conversations on React Native. Previously, this need was handled by issues labelled <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/labels/For%20Discussion\"><code>For Discussion</code></a> in the main repository, but we wanted to expand this strategy to an RFC approach that other libraries have (e.g. React).</p><p>This experiment immediately found its role in the React Native lifecycle. The Facebook team is now using the community RFC process to discuss what could <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64\">be improved in React Native</a>, and coordinate the efforts around the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6\">Lean Core project</a> - among other interesting discussions.</p><h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm\">@ReactNativeComm</a> ð£</h2><p>We are aware that our approach to communicate these efforts has not been as effective as we would have liked, and in an attempt to give you all an easier time keeping up with everything going on in the React Native Community (from releases to active discussions) we created a new twitter account that you can rely on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm\">@ReactNativeComm</a>.</p><p>If you are not on that social network, remember that you can always watch repositories via GitHub; this feature improved these past few months with the possibility of being notified only for releases, so you should consider using it anyway.</p><h2>What awaits ahead ð</h2><p>Over the past 7-8 months, core contributors enhanced the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community\">React Native Community GitHub organization</a> to take more ownership over the development of React Native, and enhance collaboration with Facebook. But this always lacked the formal structure that similar projects may have in place.</p><p>This organization can set the example for everyone in the larger developer community by enforcing a set of standards for all the packages/repos hosted in it, providing a single place for maintainers to help each other and contribute quality code that conforms to community-agreed standards.</p><p>In early 2019, we will have this new set of guidelines in place. Let us know what you think in the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/63\">dedicated discussion</a>.</p><p>We are confident that with these changes, the community will become more collaborative so that when we reach 1.0, we will all continue to write (even more) awesome apps by leveraging this joint effort ð¤</p><hr/><p>I hope you are as excited as we are about the future of this community. We&#x27;re excited to see all of you involved either in the conversations happening in the repositories listed above or via the awesome code you\u2019ll produce.</p><p>Happy coding!</p> "

As Sophie mentioned in her <a href=\"/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018\">State of React Native post,</a> we&#x27;ve sketched out a plan to better support the thriving population of React Native users and collaborators outside of Facebook. It&#x27;s now time to share more details about what we&#x27;ve been working on. Before I do so, I&#x27;d like to lay out our long-term vision for React Native in open source.</p><p>Our vision for React Native is...</p><ul><li><strong>A healthy GitHub repository.</strong> Issues and pull requests get handled within a reasonable period of time.<ul><li>Increased test coverage.</li><li>Commits that sync out from the Facebook code repository should not break open source tests.</li><li>A higher scale of meaningful community contributions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stable APIs,</strong> making it easier to interface with open source dependencies.<ul><li>Facebook uses the same public API as open source</li><li>React Native releases that follow semantic versioning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>A vibrant eco-system.</strong> High quality ViewManagers, native modules, and multiple platform support maintained by the community.</li><li><strong>Excellent documentation.</strong> Focus on helping users create high quality experiences, and up-to-date API reference docs.</li></ul><p>We have identified the following focus areas to help us achieve this vision.</p><h2>âï¸ Lean Core</h2><p>Our goal is to <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6\">reduce the surface area of React Native</a> by removing non-core and unused components. We&#x27;ll transfer non-core components to the community to allow it to move faster. The reduced surface area will make it easier to manage contributions to React Native.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0001-webview.md\"><code>WebView</code></a> is an example of a component that we transferred to the community. We are working on a workflow that will allow internal teams to continue using these components after we remove them from the repository. We have identified <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6\">dozens more components</a> that we&#x27;ll give ownership of to the community.</p><h2>ð Open Sourcing Internals and ð Updated Tooling</h2><p>The React Native development experience for product teams at Facebook can be quite different from open source. Tools that may be popular in the open source community are not used at Facebook. There may be an internal tool that achieves the same purpose. In some cases, Facebook teams have become used to tools that do not exist outside of Facebook. These disparities can pose challenges when we open source our upcoming architecture work.</p><p>We&#x27;ll work on releasing some of these internal tools. We&#x27;ll also improve support for tools popular with the open source community. Here&#x27;s a non-exhaustive list of projects we&#x27;ll tackle:</p><ul><li>Open source JSI and enable the community to bring their own JavaScript VMs, replacing the existing JavaScriptCore from RN&#x27;s initial release. We&#x27;ll be covering what JSI is in a future post, in the meantime you can learn more about JSI from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI\">Parashuram&#x27;s talk at React Conf</a>.</li><li>Support 64-bit libraries on Android.</li><li>Enable debugging under the new architecture.</li><li>Improve support for CocoaPods, Gradle, Maven, and new Xcode build system.</li></ul><h2>â Testing Infrastructure</h2><p>When Facebook engineers publish code, it&#x27;s considered safe to land if it passes all tests. These tests identify whether a change might break one of our own React Native surfaces. Yet, there are differences in how Facebook uses React Native. This has allowed us to unknowingly break React Native in open source.</p><p>We&#x27;ll shore up our internal tests to ensure they run in an environment that is as close as possible to open source. This will help prevent code that breaks these tests from making it to open source. We will also work on infrastructure to enable better testing of the core repo on GitHub, enabling future pull requests to easily include tests.</p><p>Combined with the reduced surface area, this will allow contributors to merge pull requests quicker, with confidence.</p><h2>ð Public API</h2><p>Facebook will consume React Native via the public API, the same way open source does, to reduce unintentional breaking changes. We have started converting internal call sites to address this. Our goal is to converge on a stable, public API, leading to the adoption of semantic versioning in version 1.0.</p><h2>ð£ Communication</h2><p>React Native is one of the <a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/#top-and-trending-projects\">top open source projects on GitHub</a> by contributor count. That makes us really happy, and we&#x27;d like to keep it going. We&#x27;ll continue working on initiatives that lead to involved contributors, such as increased transparency and open discussion. The documentation is one of the first things someone new to React Native will encounter, yet it has not been a priority. We&#x27;d like to fix that, starting with bringing back auto-generated API reference docs, creating additional content focused on creating <a href=\"/docs/improvingux\">quality user experiences</a>, and improving our <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/47\">release notes</a>.</p><h2>Timeline</h2><p>We&#x27;re planning to land these projects throughout the next year or so. Some of these efforts are already ongoing, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/e337bcafb0b017311c37f2dbc24e5a757af0a205...8427f64e06456f171f9df0316c6ca40613de7a20\">JSI which has already landed in open source</a>. Others will take a bit longer to complete, such as reducing the surface area. We&#x27;ll do our best to keep the community up to date with our progress. Please join us in the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals\">Discussions and Proposals</a> repository, a initiative from the React Native community that has led to the creation of several of the initiatives discussed in this roadmap.</p> "

When messages were sent from the WebView, we relied on a hack to deliver them to React Native. Succinctly, we encoded the message data into a url with a special scheme, and navigated the WebView to it. On the native side, we intercepted and cancelled this navigation, parsed the data from the url, and finally called into React Native. This implementation was error prone and insecure. I&#x27;m glad to announce that we&#x27;ve leveraged <code>WKWebView</code> features to completely replace it.</p><p>Other benefits of WKWebView over UIWebView include faster JavaScript execution, and a multi-process architecture. Please see this <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/206\">2014 WWDC</a> for more details.</p><h2>Caveats</h2><p>If your components use the following props, then you may experience problems when switching to WKWebView. For the time being, we suggest that you avoid using these props:</p><p><strong>Inconsistent behavior:</strong></p><p><code>automaticallyAdjustContentInsets</code> and <code>contentInsets</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/bacfd9297657569006bab2b1f024ad1f289b1b27\">commit</a>)</p><p>When you add contentInsets to a <code>WKWebView</code>, it doesn&#x27;t change the <code>WKWebView</code>&#x27;s viewport. The viewport remains the same size as the frame. With <code>UIWebView</code>, the viewport size actually changes (gets smaller, if the content insets are positive).</p><p><code>backgroundColor</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/215fa14efc2a817c7e038075163491c8d21526fd\">commit</a>)</p><p>With the new iOS implementation of WebView, there&#x27;s a chance that your background color will flicker into view if you use this property. Furthermore, <code>WKWebView</code> renders transparent backgrounds differently from <code>UIWebview</code>. Please look at the commit description for more details.</p><p><strong>Not supported:</strong></p><p><code>scalesPageToFit</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b18fddadfeae5512690a0a059a4fa80c864f43a3\">commit</a>)</p><p>WKWebView didn&#x27;t support the scalesPageToFit prop, so we couldn&#x27;t implement this on the WebView React Native component.</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <h2>Motivation</h2><p>As technology advances and mobile apps become increasingly important to everyday life, the necessity of creating accessible applications has likewise grown in importance.</p><p>React Native&#x27;s limited Accessibility API has always been a huge pain point for developers, so we&#x27;ve made a few updates to the Accessibility API to make it easier to create inclusive mobile applications.</p><h2>Problems With the Existing API</h2><h3>Problem One: Two Completely Different Yet Similar Props - accessibilityComponentType (Android) and accessibilityTraits (iOS)</h3><p><code>accessibilityComponentType</code> and <code>accessibilityTraits</code> are two properties that are used to tell TalkBack on Android and VoiceOver on iOS what kind of UI element the user is interacting with. The two biggest problems with these properties are that:</p><ol><li><strong>They are two different properties with different usage methods, yet have the same purpose.</strong> In the previous API, these are two separate properties (one for each platform), which was not only inconvenient, but also confusing to many developers. <code>accessibilityTraits</code> on iOS allows 17 different values while <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> on Android allows only 4 values. Furthermore, the values for the most part had no overlap. Even the input types for these two properties are different. <code>accessibilityTraits</code> allows either an array of traits to be passed in or a single trait, while <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> allows only a single value.</li><li><strong>There is very limited functionality on Android.</strong> With the old property, the only UI elements that Talkback were able to recognize were \u201Cbutton,\u201D \u201Cradiobutton_checked,\u201D and \u201Cradiobutton_unchecked.\u201D</li></ol><h3>Problem Two: Non-existent Accessibility Hints:</h3><p>Accessibility Hints help users using TalkBack or VoiceOver understand what will happen when they perform an action on an accessibility element that is not apparent by only the accessibility label. These hints can be turned on and off in the settings panel. Previously, React Native&#x27;s API did not support accessibility hints at all.</p><h3>Problem Three: Ignoring Inverted Colors:</h3><p>Some users with vision loss use inverted colors on their mobile phones to have greater screen contrast. Apple provided an API for iOS which allows developers to ignore certain views. This way, images and videos aren&#x27;t distorted when a user has the inverted colors setting on. This API is currently unsupported by React Native.</p><h2>Design of the New API</h2><h3>Solution One: Combining accessibilityComponentType (Android) and accessibilityTraits (iOS)</h3><p>In order to solve the confusion between <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> and <code>accessibilityTraits</code>, we decided to merge them into a single property. This made sense because they technically had the same intended functionality and by merging them, developers no longer had to worry about platform specific intricacies when building accessibility features.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>On iOS, <code>UIAccessibilityTraits</code> is a property that can be set on any NSObject. Each of the 17 traits passed in through the javascript property to native is mapped to a <code>UIAccessibilityTraits</code> element in Objective-C. Traits are each represented by a long int, and every trait that is set is ORed together.</p><p>On Android however, <code>AccessibilityComponentType</code> is a concept that was made up by React Native, and doesn&#x27;t directly map to any properties in Android. Accessibility is handled by an accessibility delegate. Each view has a default accessibility delegate. If you want to customize any accessibility actions, you have to create a new accessibility delegate, override specific methods you want to customize, and then set the accessibility delegate of the view you are handling to be associated with the new delegate. When a developer set <code>AccessibilityComponentType</code>, the native code created a new delegate based off of the component that was passed in, and set the view to have that accessibility delegate.</p><p><strong>Changes Made</strong></p><p>For our new property, we wanted to create a superset of the two properties. We decided to keep the new property modeled mostly after the existing property <code>accessibilityTraits</code>, since <code>accessibilityTraits</code> has significantly more values. The functionality of Android for these traits would be polyfilled in by modifying the Accessibility Delegate.</p><p>There are 17 values of UIAccessibilityTraits that <code>accessibilityTraits</code> on iOS can be set to. However, we didn&#x27;t include all of them as possible values to our new property. This is because the effect of setting some of these traits is actually not very well known, and many of these values are virtually never used.</p><p>The values UIAccessibilityTraits were set to generally took on one of two purposes. They either described a role that UI element had, or they described the state a UI element was in. Most uses of the previous properties we observed usually used one value that represented a role and combined it with either \u201Cstate selected,\u201D \u201Cstate disabled,\u201D or both. Therefore, we decided to create two new accessibility properties: <code>accessibilityRole</code> and <code>accessibilityState</code>.</p><p><strong><code>accessibilityRole</code></strong></p><p>The new property, <code>accessibilityRole</code>, is used to tell Talkback or Voiceover the role of a UI Element. This new property can take on one of the following values:</p><ul><li><code>none</code></li><li><code>button</code></li><li><code>link</code></li><li><code>search</code></li><li><code>image</code></li><li><code>keyboardkey</code></li><li><code>text</code></li><li><code>adjustable</code></li><li><code>header</code></li><li><code>summary</code></li><li><code>imagebutton</code></li></ul><p>This property only allows one value to be passed in because UI elements generally don&#x27;t logically take on more than one of these. The exception is image and button, so we&#x27;ve added a role imagebutton that is a combination of both.</p><p><strong><code>accessibilityStates</code></strong></p><p>The new property, <code>accessibilityStates</code>, is used to tell Talkback or Voiceover the state a UI Element is in. This property takes on an Array containing one or both of the following values:</p><ul><li><code>selected</code></li><li><code>disabled</code></li></ul><h3>Solution Two: Adding Accessibility Hints</h3><p>For this, we added a new property, <code>accessibilityHint</code>. Setting this property will allow Talkback or Voiceover to recite the hint to users.</p><p><strong><code>accessibilityHint</code></strong></p><p>This property takes in the accessibility hint to be read in the form of a String.</p><p>On iOS, setting this property will set the corresponding native property AccessibilityHint on the view. The hint will then be read by Voiceover if Accessibility Hints are turned on in the iPhone.</p><p>On Android, setting this property appends the value of the hint to the end of the accessibility label. The upside to this implementation is that it mimics the behavior of hints on iOS, but the downside to this implementation is that these hints cannot be turned off in the settings on Android the way they can be on iOS.</p><p>The reason we made this decision on Android is because normally, accessibility hints correspond with a specific action (e.g. click), and we wanted to keep behaviors consistent across platforms.</p><h3>Solution to Problem Three</h3><p><strong><code>accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors</code></strong></p><p>We exposed Apple&#x27;s api AccessibilityIgnoresInvertColors to JavaScript, so now when you have a view where you don&#x27;t want colors to be inverted (e.g image), you can set this property to true, and it won&#x27;t be inverted.</p><h2>New Usage</h2><p>These new properties will become available in the React Native 0.57 release.</p><h3>How to Upgrade</h3><p>If you are currently using <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> and <code>accessibilityTraits</code>, here are the steps you can take to upgrade to the new properties.</p><h4>1. Using jscodeshift</h4><p>The most simple use cases can be replaced by running a jscodeshift script.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ziqichen6/246e5778617224d2b4aff198dab0305d\">script</a> replaces the following instances:</p><pre><code>accessibilityTraits=\u201Ctrait\u201D accessibilityTraits={[\u201Ctrait\u201D]} </code></pre><p>With</p><pre><code>accessibilityRole= \u201Ctrait\u201D </code></pre><p>This script also removes instances of <code>AccessibilityComponentType</code> (assuming everywhere you set <code>AccessibilityComponentType</code>, you would also set <code>AccessibilityTraits</code>).</p><h4>2. Using a manual codemod</h4><p>For the cases that used <code>AccessibilityTraits</code> that don&#x27;t have a corresponding value for <code>AccessibilityRole</code>, and the cases where multiple traits were passed into <code>AccessibilityTraits</code>, a manual codemod would have to be done.</p><p>In general,</p><pre><code>accessibilityTraits= {[\u201Cbutton\u201D, \u201Cselected\u201D]} </code></pre><p>would be manually replaced with</p><pre><code>accessibilityRole=\u201Cbutton\u201D accessibilityStates={[\u201Cselected\u201D]} </code></pre><p>These properties are already being used in Facebook&#x27;s codebase. The codemod for Facebook was surprisingly simple. The jscodeshift script fixed about half of our instances, and the other half was fixed manually. Overall, the entire process took less than a few hours.</p><p>Hopefully you will find the updated API useful! And please continue making apps accessible! #inclusion</p> "

This blog post highlights some of the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#highlights\">changes</a> introduced in this new release. We also want to take the opportunity to explain what has kept us busy since March.</p><h3>The breaking changes dilemma, or, \"when to release?\"</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">Contributor&#x27;s Guide</a> explains the integration process that all changes to React Native go through. The project has is composed by <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/370\">many different tools</a>, requiring coordination and constant support to keep everything working properly. Add to this the vibrant open source community that contributes back to the project, and you will get a sense of the mind-bending scale of it all.</p><p>With React Native&#x27;s impressive adoption, breaking changes must be made with great care, and the process is not as smooth as we&#x27;d like. A decision was made to skip the April and May releases to allow the core team to integrate and test a new set of breaking changes. <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/14\">Dedicated community communication</a> channels were used along the way to ensure that the June 2018 (<code>0.56.0</code>) release is as hassle-free as possible to adopt by those who patiently waited for the stable release.</p><p>Is <code>0.56.0</code> perfect? No, as every piece of software out there: but we reached a point where the tradeoff between \"waiting for more stability\" versus \"testing led to successful results so we can push forward\" that we feel ready to release it. Moreover, we are aware <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19955\">of</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19827\">a</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19763\">few</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19859\">issues</a> that are not solved in the final <code>0.56.0</code> release. Most developers should have no issues upgrading to <code>0.56.0</code>. For those that are blocked by the aforementioned issues, we hope to see you around in our discussions and we are looking forward to working with you on a solution to these issues.</p><p>You might consider <code>0.56.0</code> as a fundamental building block towards a more stable framework: it will take probably a week or two of widespread adoption before all the edge cases will be sanded off, but this will lead to an even better July 2018 (<code>0.57.0</code>) release.</p><p>We&#x27;d like to conclude this section by thanking <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/v0.55.4...v0.56.0-rc.4\">all the 67 contributors who worked on a total of 818 commits</a> (!) that will help make your apps even better ð.</p><p>And now, without further ado...</p><h2>The Big Changes</h2><h3>Babel 7</h3><p>As you may know, the transpiler tool that allows us all to use the latest and greatest features of JavaScript, Babel, is moving to <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release\">v7 soon</a>. Since this new version brings along some important changes, we felt that now it would be a good time to upgrade, allowing <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro\">Metro</a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/92\">leverage on its improvements</a>.</p><p>If you find yourself in trouble with upgrading, please refer to the <a href=\"https://new.babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration.html\">documentation section related to it</a>.</p><h3>Modernizing Android support</h3><p>On Android, much of the surrounding tooling has changed. We&#x27;ve updated to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/699e5eebe807d1ced660d2d2f39b5679d26925da\">Gradle 3.5</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/065c5b6590de18281a8c592a04240751c655c03c\">Android SDK 26</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6b07602915157f54c39adbf0f9746ac056ad2d13\">Fresco to 1.9.0, and OkHttp to 3.10.0</a> and even the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5ae97990418db613cd67b1fb9070ece976d17dc7\">NDK API target to API 16</a>. These changes should go without issue and result in faster builds. More importantly, it will help developers comply with the <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html\">new Play Store requirements</a> coming into effect next month.</p><p>Related to this, we&#x27;d like to particularly thank <a href=\"https://github.com/dulmandakh\">Dulmandakh</a> for the many PRs submitted in order to make it possible ð.</p><p>There are some more steps that need to be taken in this direction, and you can follow along with the future planning and discussion of updating the Android support in the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19297\">dedicated issue</a> (and a side one for the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19737\">JSC</a>).</p><h3>New Node, Xcode, React, and Flow \u2013 oh my!</h3><p>Node 8 is now the standard for React Native. It was actually already being tested already, but we&#x27;ve put both feet forward as Node 6 entered maintenance mode. React was also updated to 16.4, which brings a ton of fixes with it.</p><p>We&#x27;re dropping support for iOS 8, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f50df4f5eca4b4324ff18a49dcf8be3694482b51\">making iOS 9 the oldest iOS version that can be targeted</a>. We do not foresee this being a problem, as any device that can run iOS 8, can be upgraded to iOS 9. This change allowed us to remove rarely-used code that implemented workarounds for older devices running iOS 8.</p><p>The continuous integration toolchain has been updated <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c55bcd6ea729cdf57fc14a5478b7c2e3f6b2a94d\">to use Xcode 9.4</a>, ensuring that all iOS tests are run on the latest developer tools provided by Apple.</p><p>We have upgraded to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6264b6932a08e1cefd83c4536ff7839d91938730\">Flow 0.75</a> to use the new error format <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/998610821096857602\">that many devs appreciate</a>. We&#x27;ve also created types for many more components. If you&#x27;re not yet enforcing static typing in your project, please consider using Flow to identify problems as you code instead of at runtime.</p><h3>And a lot of other things...</h3><p>For instance, YellowBox was <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d0219a0301e59e8b0ef75dbd786318d4b4619f4c\">replaced</a> with a new implementation that makes debugging a lot better.</p><p>For the complete release notes, please reference the full <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog here</a>. And remember to keep an eye on the <a href=\"/docs/upgrading\">upgrading guide</a> to avoid issues moving to this new version.</p><hr/><p>A final note: starting this week, the React Native core team will resume holding monthly meetings. We&#x27;ll make sure to keep everyone up-to-date with what&#x27;s covered, and ensure to keep your feedback at hand for future meetings.</p><p>Happy coding everyone!</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kelset\">Lorenzo</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/turnrye\">Ryan</a>, and the whole <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reactnative\">React Native core team</a></p><p><strong>PS:</strong> as always, we&#x27;d like to remind everyone that React Native is still in 0.x versioning because of the many changes still undergoing - so remember when upgrading that yes, probably, something may still crash or be broken. Be helpful towards each other in the issues and when submitting PRs - and remember to follow the <a href=\"https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct/\">CoC</a> enforced: there&#x27;s always a human on the other side of the screen.</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>It&#x27;s been a while since we last published a status update about React Native.</p><p>At Facebook, we&#x27;re using React Native more than ever and for many important projects. One of our most popular products is Marketplace, one of the top-level tabs in our app which is used by 800 million people each month. Since its creation in 2015, all of Marketplace has been built with React Native, including over a hundred full-screen views throughout different parts of the app.</p><p>We&#x27;re also using React Native for many new parts of the app. If you watched the F8 keynote last month, you&#x27;ll recognize Blood Donations, Crisis Response, Privacy Shortcuts, and Wellness Checks \u2013 all recent features built with React Native. And projects outside the main Facebook app are using React Native too. The new Oculus Go VR headset includes <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/app/\">a companion mobile app</a> that is fully built with React Native, not to mention React VR powering many experiences in the headset itself.</p><p>Naturally, we also use many other technologies to build our apps. <a href=\"https://fblitho.com/\">Litho</a> and <a href=\"https://componentkit.org/\">ComponentKit</a> are two libraries we use extensively in our apps; both provide a React-like component API for building native screens. It&#x27;s never been a goal for React Native to replace all other technologies \u2013 we are focused on making React Native itself better, but we love seeing other teams borrow ideas from React Native, like bringing <a href=\"https://instagram-engineering.com/instant-feedback-in-ios-engineering-workflows-c3f6508c76c8\">instant reload</a> to non-JavaScript code too.</p><h2>Architecture</h2><p>When we started the React Native project in 2013, we designed it to have a single \u201Cbridge\u201D between JavaScript and native that is asynchronous, serializable, and batched. Just as React DOM turns React state updates into imperative, mutative calls to DOM APIs like <code>document.createElement(attrs)</code> and <code>.appendChild()</code>, React Native was designed to return a single JSON message that lists mutations to perform, like <code>[[\"createView\", attrs], [\"manageChildren\", ...]]</code>. We designed the entire system to never rely on getting a synchronous response back and to ensure everything in that list could be fully serialized to JSON and back. We did this for the flexibility it gave us: on top of this architecture, we were able to build tools like <a href=\"/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools\">Chrome debugging</a>, which runs all the JavaScript code asynchronously over a WebSocket connection.</p><p>Over the last 5 years, we found that these initial principles have made building some features harder. An asynchronous bridge means you can&#x27;t integrate JavaScript logic directly with many native APIs expecting synchronous answers. A batched bridge that queues native calls means it&#x27;s harder to have React Native apps call into functions that are implemented natively. And a serializable bridge means unnecessary copying instead of directly sharing memory between the two worlds. For apps that are entirely built in React Native, these restrictions are usually bearable. But for apps with complex integration between React Native and existing app code, they are frustrating.</p><p><strong>We&#x27;re working on a large-scale rearchitecture of React Native to make the framework more flexible and integrate better with native infrastructure in hybrid JavaScript/native apps.</strong> With this project, we&#x27;ll apply what we&#x27;ve learned over the last 5 years and incrementally bring our architecture to a more modern one. We&#x27;re rewriting many of React Native&#x27;s internals, but most of the changes are under the hood: existing React Native apps will continue to work with few or no changes.</p><p>To make React Native more lightweight and fit better into existing native apps, this rearchitecture has three major internal changes. First, we are changing the threading model. Instead of each UI update needing to perform work on three different threads, it will be possible to call synchronously into JavaScript on any thread for high-priority updates while still keeping low-priority work off the main thread to maintain responsiveness. Second, we are incorporating <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html\">async rendering</a> capabilities into React Native to allow multiple rendering priorities and to simplify asynchronous data handling. Finally, we are simplifying our bridge to make it faster and more lightweight; direct calls between native and JavaScript are more efficient and will make it easier to build debugging tools like cross-language stack traces.</p><p>Once these changes are completed, closer integrations will be possible. Today, it&#x27;s not possible to incorporate native navigation and gesture handling or native components like UICollectionView and RecyclerView without complex hacks. After our changes to the threading model, building features like this will be straightforward.</p><p>We&#x27;ll release more details about this work later this year as it approaches completion.</p><h2>Community</h2><p>Alongside the community inside Facebook, we&#x27;re happy to have a thriving population of React Native users and collaborators outside Facebook. We&#x27;d like to support the React Native community more, both by serving React Native users better and by making the project easier to contribute to.</p><p>Just as our architecture changes will help React Native interoperate more cleanly with other native infrastructure, React Native should be slimmer on the JavaScript side to fit better with the JavaScript ecosystem, which includes making the VM and bundler swappable. We know the pace of breaking changes can be hard to keep up with, so we&#x27;d like to find ways to have fewer major releases. Finally, we know that some teams are looking for more thorough documentation in topics like startup optimization, where our expertise hasn&#x27;t yet been written down. Expect to see some of these changes over the coming year.</p><p>If you&#x27;re using React Native, you&#x27;re part of our community; keep letting us know how we can make React Native better for you.</p><p>React Native is just one tool in a mobile developer&#x27;s toolbox, but it&#x27;s one that we strongly believe in \u2013 and we&#x27;re making it better every day, with over 2500 commits in the last year from 500+ contributors.</p> "

Luckily, options exist to add stronger types to JavaScript. My favourite is <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a>, but React Native supports <a href=\"https://flow.org\">Flow</a> out of the box. Which you prefer is a matter of preference, they each have their own approach on how to add the magic of types to JavaScript. Today, we&#x27;re going to look at how to use TypeScript in React Native apps.</p><p>This post uses Microsoft&#x27;s <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Native-Starter\">TypeScript-React-Native-Starter</a> repo as a guide.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: Since this blog post was written, things have gotten even easier. You can replace all the set up described in this blog post by running just one command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">npx react-native init MyAwesomeProject --template react-native-template-typescript </code></pre><p>However, there <em>are</em> some limitations to Babel&#x27;s TypeScript support, which the blog post above goes into in detail. The steps outlined in <em>this</em> post still work, and Artsy is still using <a href=\"https://github.com/ds300/react-native-typescript-transformer\">react-native-typescript-transformer</a> in production, but the fastest way to get up and running with React Native and TypeScript is using the above command. You can always switch later if you have to.</p><p>In any case, have fun! The original blog post continues below.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>Because you might be developing on one of several different platforms, targeting several different types of devices, basic setup can be involved. You should first ensure that you can run a plain React Native app without TypeScript. Follow <a href=\"/docs/getting-started\">the instructions on the React Native website to get started</a>. When you&#x27;ve managed to deploy to a device or emulator, you&#x27;ll be ready to start a TypeScript React Native app.</p><p>You will also need <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com\">npm</a>, and <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en\">Yarn</a>.</p><h2>Initializing</h2><p>Once you&#x27;ve tried scaffolding out an ordinary React Native project, you&#x27;ll be ready to start adding TypeScript. Let&#x27;s go ahead and do that.</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">react-native init MyAwesomeProject cd MyAwesomeProject </code></pre><h2>Adding TypeScript</h2><p>The next step is to add TypeScript to your project. The following commands will:</p><ul><li>add TypeScript to your project</li><li>add <a href=\"https://github.com/ds300/react-native-typescript-transformer\">React Native TypeScript Transformer</a> to your project</li><li>initialize an empty TypeScript config file, which we&#x27;ll configure next</li><li>add an empty React Native TypeScript Transformer config file, which we&#x27;ll configure next</li><li>adds <a href=\"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped\">typings</a> for React and React Native</li></ul><p>Okay, let&#x27;s go ahead and run these.</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">yarn add --dev typescript yarn add --dev react-native-typescript-transformer yarn tsc --init --pretty --jsx react touch rn-cli.config.js yarn add --dev @types/react @types/react-native </code></pre><p>The <code>tsconfig.json</code> file contains all the settings for the TypeScript compiler. The defaults created by the command above are mostly fine, but open the file and uncomment the following line:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">{ /* Search the config file for the following line and uncomment it. */ // \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true, /* Allow default imports from modules with no default export. This does not affect code emit, just typechecking. */ } </code></pre><p>The <code>rn-cli.config.js</code> contains the settings for the React Native TypeScript Transformer. Open it and add the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">module.exports = { getTransformModulePath() { return require.resolve(&#x27;react-native-typescript-transformer&#x27;); }, getSourceExts() { return [&#x27;ts&#x27;, &#x27;tsx&#x27;]; } }; </code></pre><h2>Migrating to TypeScript</h2><p>Rename the generated <code>App.js</code> and <code>__tests_/App.js</code> files to <code>App.tsx</code>. <code>index.js</code> needs to use the <code>.js</code> extension. All new files should use the <code>.tsx</code> extension (or <code>.ts</code> if the file doesn&#x27;t contain any JSX).</p><p>If you tried to run the app now, you&#x27;d get an error like <code>object prototype may only be an object or null</code>. This is caused by a failure to import the default export from React as well as a named export on the same line. Open <code>App.tsx</code> and modify the import at the top of the file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-diff\">-import React, { Component } from &#x27;react&#x27;; +import React from &#x27;react&#x27; +import { Component } from &#x27;react&#x27;; </code></pre><p>Some of this has to do with differences in how Babel and TypeScript interoperate with CommonJS modules. In the future, the two will stabilize on the same behaviour.</p><p>At this point, you should be able to run the React Native app.</p><h2>Adding TypeScript Testing Infrastructure</h2><p>React Native ships with <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/jest\">Jest</a>, so for testing a React Native app with TypeScript, we&#x27;ll want to add <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest\">ts-jest</a> to our <code>devDependencies</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">yarn add --dev ts-jest </code></pre><p>Then, we&#x27;ll open up our <code>package.json</code> and replace the <code>jest</code> field with the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">{ \"jest\": { \"preset\": \"react-native\", \"moduleFileExtensions\": [ \"ts\", \"tsx\", \"js\" ], \"transform\": { \"^.+\\\\.(js)$\": \"<rootDir>/node_modules/babel-jest\", \"\\\\.(ts|tsx)$\": \"<rootDir>/node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js\" }, \"testRegex\": \"(/__tests__/.*|\\\\.(test|spec))\\\\.(ts|tsx|js)$\", \"testPathIgnorePatterns\": [ \"\\\\.snap$\", \"<rootDir>/node_modules/\" ], \"cacheDirectory\": \".jest/cache\" } } </code></pre><p>This will configure Jest to run <code>.ts</code> and <code>.tsx</code> files with <code>ts-jest</code>.</p><h2>Installing Dependency Type Declarations</h2><p>To get the best experience in TypeScript, we want the type-checker to understand the shape and API of our dependencies. Some libraries will publish their packages with <code>.d.ts</code> files (type declaration/type definition files), which can describe the shape of the underlying JavaScript. For other libraries, we&#x27;ll need to explicitly install the appropriate package in the <code>@types/</code> npm scope.</p><p>For example, here we&#x27;ll need types for Jest, React, and React Native, and React Test Renderer.</p><pre><code class=\"language-ts\">yarn add --dev @types/jest @types/react @types/react-native @types/react-test-renderer </code></pre><p>We saved these declaration file packages to our <em>dev</em> dependencies because this is a React Native <em>app</em> that only uses these dependencies during development and not during runtime. If we were publishing a library to NPM, we might have to add some of these type dependencies as regular dependencies.</p><p>You can read more <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/consumption.html\">here about getting <code>.d.ts</code> files</a>.</p><h2>Ignoring More Files</h2><p>For your source control, you&#x27;ll want to start ignoring the <code>.jest</code> folder. If you&#x27;re using git, we can just add entries to our <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><pre><code class=\"language-config\"># Jest # .jest/ </code></pre><p>As a checkpoint, consider committing your files into version control.</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">git init git add .gitignore # import to do this first, to ignore our files git add . git commit -am \"Initial commit.\" </code></pre><h2>Adding a Component</h2><p>Let&#x27;s add a component to our app. Let&#x27;s go ahead and create a <code>Hello.tsx</code> component. It&#x27;s a pedagogical component, not something that you&#x27;d actually write in an app, but something nontrivial that shows off how to use TypeScript in React Native.</p><p>Create a <code>components</code> directory and add the following example.</p><pre><code class=\"language-ts\">// components/Hello.tsx import React from &#x27;react&#x27;; import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; export interface Props { name: string; enthusiasmLevel?: number; } interface State { enthusiasmLevel: number; } export class Hello extends React.Component<Props, State> { constructor(props: Props) { super(props); if ((props.enthusiasmLevel || 0) <= 0) { throw new Error( &#x27;You could be a little more enthusiastic. :D&#x27; ); } this.state = { enthusiasmLevel: props.enthusiasmLevel || 1 }; } onIncrement = () => this.setState({ enthusiasmLevel: this.state.enthusiasmLevel + 1 }); onDecrement = () => this.setState({ enthusiasmLevel: this.state.enthusiasmLevel - 1 }); getExclamationMarks = (numChars: number) => Array(numChars + 1).join(&#x27;!&#x27;); render() { return ( <View style={styles.root}> <Text style={styles.greeting}> Hello{&#x27; &#x27;} {this.props.name + this.getExclamationMarks(this.state.enthusiasmLevel)} </Text> <View style={styles.buttons}> <View style={styles.button}> <Button title=\"-\" onPress={this.onDecrement} accessibilityLabel=\"decrement\" color=\"red\" /> </View> <View style={styles.button}> <Button title=\"+\" onPress={this.onIncrement} accessibilityLabel=\"increment\" color=\"blue\" /> </View> </View> </View> ); } } // styles const styles = StyleSheet.create({ root: { alignItems: &#x27;center&#x27;, alignSelf: &#x27;center&#x27; }, buttons: { flexDirection: &#x27;row&#x27;, minHeight: 70, alignItems: &#x27;stretch&#x27;, alignSelf: &#x27;center&#x27;, borderWidth: 5 }, button: { flex: 1, paddingVertical: 0 }, greeting: { color: &#x27;#999&#x27;, fontWeight: &#x27;bold&#x27; } }); </code></pre><p>Whoa! That&#x27;s a lot, but let&#x27;s break it down:</p><ul><li>Instead of rendering HTML elements like <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, <code>h1</code>, etc., we&#x27;re rendering components like <code>View</code> and <code>Button</code>. These are native components that work across different platforms.</li><li>Styling is specified using the <code>StyleSheet.create</code> function that React Native gives us. React&#x27;s stylesheets allow us to control our layout using Flexbox, and style using other constructs similar to those in CSS.</li></ul><h2>Adding a Component Test</h2><p>Now that we&#x27;ve got a component, let&#x27;s try testing it.</p><p>We already have Jest installed as a test runner. We&#x27;re going to write snapshot tests for our components, let&#x27;s add the required add-on for snapshot tests:</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">yarn add --dev react-addons-test-utils </code></pre><p>Now let&#x27;s create a <code>__tests__</code> folder in the <code>components</code> directory and add a test for <code>Hello.tsx</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-ts\">// components/__tests__/Hello.tsx import React from &#x27;react&#x27;; import renderer from &#x27;react-test-renderer&#x27;; import { Hello } from &#x27;../Hello&#x27;; it(&#x27;renders correctly with defaults&#x27;, () => { const button = renderer .create(<Hello name=\"World\" enthusiasmLevel={1} />) .toJSON(); expect(button).toMatchSnapshot(); }); </code></pre><p>The first time the test is run, it will create a snapshot of the rendered component and store it in the <code>components/__tests__/__snapshots__/Hello.tsx.snap</code> file. When you modify your component, you&#x27;ll need to update the snapshots and review the update for inadvertent changes. You can read more about testing React Native components <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react-native.html\">here</a>.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Check out the official <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\">React tutorial</a> and state-management library <a href=\"http://redux.js.org\">Redux</a>. These resources can be helpful when writing React Native apps. Additionally, you may want to look at <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/\">ReactXP</a>, a component library written entirely in TypeScript that supports both React on the web as well as React Native.</p><p>Have fun in a more type-safe React Native development environment!</p> "

Over the last two years, we\u2019ve continued to upgrade and expand the app. We are currently on React Native version 0.53.0.</p><p>You can check out the app at <a href=\"https://www.build.com/app\">https://www.build.com/app</a>.</p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/blog/assets/build-com-blog-image.jpg\"/></p><h2>Features</h2><p>Our app is full featured and includes everything that you\u2019d expect from an e-commerce app: product listings, search and sorting, the ability to configure complex products, favorites, etc. We accept standard credit card payment methods as well as PayPal, and Apple Pay for our iOS users.</p><p>A few standout features you might not expect include:</p><ol><li>3D models available for around 40 products with 90 finishes</li><li>Augmented Reality (AR) to allow the user to see how lights and faucets will look in their home at 98% size accuracy. The Build.com React Native App is featured in the Apple App store for AR Shopping! AR is now available for Android and iOS!</li><li>Collaborative project management features that allow people to put together shopping lists for the different phases of their project and collaborate around selection</li></ol><p>We\u2019re working on many new and exciting features that will continue to improve our app experience including the next phase of Immersive Shopping with AR.</p><h2>Our Development Workflow</h2><p>Build.com allows each dev to choose the tools that best suit them.</p><ul><li>IDEs include Atom, IntelliJ, VS Code, Sublime, Eclipse, etc.</li><li>For Unit testing, developers are responsible for creating Jest unit tests for any new components and we\u2019re working to increase the coverage of older parts of the app using <code>jest-coverage-ratchet</code>.</li><li>We use Jenkins to build out our beta and release candidates. This process works well for us but still requires significant work to create the release notes and other artifacts.</li><li>Integration Testing include a shared pool of testers that work across desktop, mobile and web. Our automation engineer is building out our suite of automated integration tests using Java and Appium.</li><li>Other parts of the workflow include a detailed eslint configuration, custom rules that enforce properties needed for testing, and pre-push hooks that block offending changes.</li></ul><h2>Libraries Used in the App</h2><p>The Build.com app relies on a number of common open source libraries including: Redux, Moment, Numeral, Enzyme and a bunch of React Native bridge modules. We also use a number of forked open source libraries; forked either because they were abandoned or because we needed custom features. A quick count shows around 115 JavaScript and native dependencies. We would like to explore tools that remove unused libraries.</p><p>We&#x27;re in the process of adding static typing via TypeScript and looking into optional chaining. These features could help us with solving a couple classes of bugs that we still see:</p><ul><li>Data that is the wrong type</li><li>Data that is undefined because an object didn\u2019t contain what we expected</li></ul><h2>Open Source Contributions</h2><p>Since we rely so heavily on open source, our team is committed to contributing back to the community. Build.com allows the team to open source libraries that we&#x27;ve built and encourages us contribute back to the libraries that we use.</p><p>We\u2019ve released and maintained a number of React Native libraries:</p><ul><li><code>react-native-polyfill</code></li><li><code>react-native-simple-store</code></li><li><code>react-native-contact-picker</code></li></ul><p>We have also contributed to a long list of libraries including: React and React Native, <code>react-native-schemes-manager</code>, <code>react-native-swipeable</code>, <code>react-native-gallery</code>, <code>react-native-view-transformer</code>, <code>react-native-navigation</code>.</p><h2>Our Journey</h2><p>We\u2019ve seen a lot of growth in React Native and the ecosystem in the past couple years. Early on, it seemed that every version of React Native would fix some bugs but introduce several more. For example, Remote JS Debugging was broken on Android for several months. Thankfully, things became much more stable in 2017.</p><h3>Navigation Libraries</h3><p>One of our big recurring challenges has been with navigation libraries. For a long time, we were using Expo\u2019s ex-nav library. It worked well for us but it was eventually deprecated. However, we were in heavy feature development at the time so taking time to change out a navigation library wasn\u2019t feasible. That meant we had to fork the library and patch it to support React 16 and the iPhone X. Eventually, we were able to migrate to <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation\"><code>react-native-navigation</code></a> and hopefully that will see continued support.</p><h3>Bridge Modules</h3><p>Another big challenge has been with bridge modules. When we first started, a lot of critical bridges were missing. One of my teammates wrote <code>react-native-contact-picker</code> because we needed access to the Android contact picker in our app. We\u2019ve also seen a lot of bridges that were broken by changes within React Native. For example, there was a breaking change within React Native v40 and when we upgraded our app, I had to submit PRs to fix 3 or 4 libraries that had not yet been updated.</p><h2>Looking Forward</h2><p>As React Native continues to grow, our wishlist to our community include:</p><ul><li>Stabilize and improve the navigation libraries</li><li>Maintain support for libraries in the React Native ecosystem</li><li>Improve the experience for adding native libraries and bridge modules to a project</li></ul><p>Companies and individuals in the React Native community have been great about volunteering their time and effort to improve the tools that we all use. If you haven\u2019t gotten involved in open source, I hope you\u2019ll take a look at improving the code or documentation for some of the libraries that you use. There are a lot of articles to help you get started and it may be a lot easier than you think!</p> "

          },
          "content:encoded": {
            "#cdata-section": " <h2>Motivation</h2><p>Three years ago, a GitHub issue was opened to support input accessory view from React Native.</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/input-accessory-1.png\"/><p>In the ensuing years, there have been countless &#x27;+1s&#x27;, various workarounds, and zero concrete changes to RN on this issue - until today. Starting with iOS, <a href=\"/docs/inputaccessoryview\">we&#x27;re exposing an API</a> for accessing the native input accessory view and we are excited to share how we built it.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>What exactly is an input accessory view? Reading <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621119-inputaccessoryview?language=objc\">Apple&#x27;s developer documentation</a>, we learn that it&#x27;s a custom view which can be anchored to the top of the system keyboard whenever a receiver becomes the first responder. Anything that inherits from <code>UIResponder</code> can redeclare the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> property as read-write, and manage a custom view here. The responder infrastructure mounts the view, and keeps it in sync with the system keyboard. Gestures which dismiss the keyboard, like a drag or tap, are applied to the input accessory view at the framework level. This allows us to build content with interactive keyboard dismissal, an integral feature in top-tier messaging apps like iMessage and WhatsApp.</p><p>There are two common use cases for anchoring a view to the top of the keyboard. The first is creating a keyboard toolbar, like the Facebook composer background picker.</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/input-accessory-2.gif\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:70px;padding-top:20px\"/><p>In this scenario, the keyboard is focused on a text input field, and the input accessory view is used to provide additional keyboard functionality. This functionality is contextual to the type of input field. In a mapping application it could be address suggestions, or in a text editor, it could be rich text formatting tools.</p><hr style=\"clear:both;margin-bottom:20px\"/><p>The Objective-C UIResponder who owns the <code><InputAccessoryView></code> in this scenario should be clear. The <code><TextInput></code> has become first responder, and under the hood this becomes an instance of <code>UITextView</code> or <code>UITextField</code>.</p><p>The second common scenario is sticky text inputs:</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/input-accessory-3.gif\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:70px;padding-top:20px\"/><p>Here, the text input is actually part of the input accessory view itself. This is commonly used in messaging applications, where a message can be composed while scrolling through a thread of previous messages.</p><hr style=\"clear:both;margin-bottom:20px\"/><p>Who owns the <code><InputAccessoryView></code> in this example? Can it be the <code>UITextView</code> or <code>UITextField</code> again? The text input is <em>inside</em> the input accessory view, this sounds like a circular dependency. Solving this issue alone is <a href=\"http://derpturkey.com/uitextfield-docked-like-ios-messenger/\">another blog post</a> in itself. Spoilers: the owner is a generic <code>UIView</code> subclass who we manually tell to <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621113-becomefirstresponder?language=objc\">becomeFirstResponder</a>.</p><h2>API Design</h2><p>We now know what an <code><InputAccessoryView></code> is, and how we want to use it. The next step is designing an API that makes sense for both use cases, and works well with existing React Native components like <code><TextInput></code>.</p><p>For keyboard toolbars, there are a few things we want to consider:</p><ol><li>We want to be able to hoist any generic React Native view hierarchy into the <code><InputAccessoryView></code>.</li><li>We want this generic and detached view hierarchy to accept touches and be able to manipulate application state.</li><li>We want to link an <code><InputAccessoryView></code> to a particular <code><TextInput></code>.</li><li>We want to be able to share an <code><InputAccessoryView></code> across multiple text inputs, without duplicating any code.</li></ol><p>We can achieve #1 using a concept similar to <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html\">React portals</a>. In this design, we portal React Native views to a <code>UIView</code> hierarchy managed by the responder infrastructure. Since React Native views render as UIViews, this is actually quite straightforward - we can just override:</p><p><code>- (void)insertReactSubview:(UIView *)subview atIndex:(NSInteger)atIndex</code></p><p>and pipe all the subviews to a new UIView hierarchy. For #2, we set up a new <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Base/RCTTouchHandler.h\">RCTTouchHandler</a> for the <code><InputAccessoryView></code>. State updates are achieved by using regular event callbacks. For #3 and #4, we use the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Views/UIView%2BReact.h#L28\">nativeID</a> field to locate the accessory view UIView hierarchy in native code during the creation of a <code><TextInput></code> component. This function uses the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> property of the underlying native text input. Doing this effectively links <code><InputAccessoryView></code> to <code><TextInput></code> in their ObjC implementations.</p><p>Supporting sticky text inputs (scenario 2) adds a few more constraints. For this design, the input accessory view has a text input as a child, so linking via nativeID is not an option. Instead, we set the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> of a generic off-screen <code>UIView</code> to our native <code><InputAccessoryView></code> hierarchy. By manually telling this generic <code>UIView</code> to become first responder, the hierarchy is mounted by responder infrastructure. This concept is explained thoroughly in the aforementioned blog post.</p><h2>Pitfalls</h2><p>Of course not everything was smooth sailing while building this API. Here are a few pitfalls we encountered, along with how we fixed them.</p><p>An initial idea for building this API involved listening to <code>NSNotificationCenter</code> for UIKeyboardWill(Show/Hide/ChangeFrame) events. This pattern is used in some open-sourced libraries, and internally in some parts of the Facebook app. Unfortunately, <code>UIKeyboardDidChangeFrame</code> events were not being called in time to update the <code><InputAccessoryView></code> frame on swipes. Also, changes in keyboard height are not captured by these events. This creates a class of bugs that manifest like this:</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/input-accessory-4.gif\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:70px;padding-top:20px\"/><p>On iPhone X, text and emoji keyboard are different heights. Most applications using keyboard events to manipulate text input frames had to fix the above bug. Our solution was to commit to using the <code>.inputAccessoryView</code> property, which meant that the responder infrastructure handles frame updates like this.</p><hr style=\"clear:both;margin-bottom:20px\"/><p>Another tricky bug we encountered was avoiding the home pill on iPhone X. You may be thinking, \u201CApple developed <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/2891102-safearealayoutguide?language=objc\">safeAreaLayoutGuide</a> for this very reason, this is trivial!\u201D. We were just as naive. The first issue is that the native <code><InputAccessoryView></code> implementation has no window to anchor to until the moment it is about to appear. That&#x27;s alright, we can override <code>-(BOOL)becomeFirstResponder</code> and enforce layout constraints there. Adhering to these constraints bumps the accessory view up, but another bug arises: <img src=\"/blog/assets/input-accessory-5.gif\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:70px;padding-top:20px\"/></p><p>The input accessory view successfully avoids the home pill, but now content behind the unsafe area is visible. The solution lies in this <a href=\"http://www.openradar.me/34411433\">radar</a>. I wrapped the native <code><InputAccessoryView></code> hierarchy in a container which doesn&#x27;t conform to the <code>safeAreaLayoutGuide</code> constraints. The native container covers the content in the unsafe area, while the <code><InputAccessoryView></code> stays within the safe area boundaries.</p><hr style=\"clear:both;margin-bottom:20px\"/><h2>Example Usage</h2><p>Here&#x27;s an example which builds a keyboard toolbar button to reset <code><TextInput></code> state.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">class TextInputAccessoryViewExample extends React.Component< {}, * > { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { text: &#x27;Placeholder Text&#x27; }; } render() { const inputAccessoryViewID = &#x27;inputAccessoryView1&#x27;; return ( <View> <TextInput style={styles.default} inputAccessoryViewID={inputAccessoryViewID} onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({ text })} value={this.state.text} /> <InputAccessoryView nativeID={inputAccessoryViewID}> <View style={{ backgroundColor: &#x27;white&#x27; }}> <Button onPress={() => this.setState({ text: &#x27;Placeholder Text&#x27; }) } title=\"Reset Text\" /> </View> </InputAccessoryView> </View> ); } } </code></pre><p>Another example for <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/84ef7bc372ad870127b3e1fb8c13399fe09ecd4d/RNTester/js/InputAccessoryViewExample.js\">Sticky Text Inputs can be found in the repository</a>.</p><h2>When will I be able to use this?</h2><p>The full commit for this feature implementation is <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/38197c8230657d567170cdaf8ff4bbb4aee732b8\">here</a>. <a href=\"/docs/next/inputaccessoryview\"><code><InputAccessoryView></code></a> will be available in the upcoming v0.55.0 release.</p><p>Happy keyboarding :)</p> "

We began with a <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-react-native-starter\">complete starter kit</a>, but have a few more recent developments.</p><p>This blog post talks about some interesting things for React and React Native developers:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify\"><strong>AWS Amplify</strong></a>, a declarative library for JavaScript applications using cloud services</li><li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/\"><strong>AWS AppSync</strong></a>, a fully managed GraphQL service with offline and real-time features</li></ul><h2>AWS Amplify</h2><p>React Native applications are very easy to bootstrap using tools like Create React Native App and Expo. However, connecting them to the cloud can be challenging to navigate when you try to match a use case to infrastructure services. For example, your React Native app might need to upload photos. Should these be protected per user? That probably means you need some sort of registration or sign-in process. Do you want your own user directory or are you using a social media provider? Maybe your app also needs to call an API with custom business logic after users log in.</p><p>To help JavaScript developers with these problems, we released a library named AWS Amplify. The design is broken into \"categories\" of tasks, instead of AWS-specific implementations. For example, if you wanted users to register, log in, and then upload private photos, you would simply pull in <code>Auth</code> and <code>Storage</code> categories to your application:</p><pre><code>import { Auth } from &#x27;aws-amplify&#x27;; Auth.signIn(username, password) .then(user => console.log(user)) .catch(err => console.log(err)); Auth.confirmSignIn(user, code) .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(err => console.log(err)); </code></pre><p>In the code above, you can see an example of some of the common tasks that Amplify helps you with, such as using multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes with either email or SMS. The supported categories today are:</p><ul><li><strong>Auth</strong>: Provides credential automation. Out-of-the-box implementation uses AWS credentials for signing, and OIDC JWT tokens from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a>. Common functionality, such as MFA features, is supported.</li><li><strong>Analytics</strong>: With a single line of code, get tracking for authenticated or unauthenticated users in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/\">Amazon Pinpoint</a>. Extend this for custom metrics or attributes, as you prefer.</li><li><strong>API</strong>: Provides interaction with RESTful APIs in a secure manner, leveraging <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">AWS Signature Version 4</a>. The API module is great on serverless infrastructures with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\">Amazon API Gateway</a>.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: Simplified commands to upload, download, and list content in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a>. You can also easily group data into public or private content on a per-user basis.</li><li><strong>Caching</strong>: An LRU cache interface across web apps and React Native that uses implementation-specific persistence.</li><li><strong>i18n and Logging</strong>: Provides internationalization and localization capabilities, as well as debugging and logging capabilities.</li></ul><p>One of the nice things about Amplify is that it encodes \"best practices\" in the design for your specific programming environment. For example, one thing we found working with customers and React Native developers is that shortcuts taken during development to get things working quickly would make it through to production stacks. These can compromise either scalability or security, and force infrastructure rearchitecture and code refactoring.</p><p>One example of how we help developers avoid this is the <a href=\"https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2016/06/aws-lambda-serverless-reference-architectures.html\">Serverless Reference Architectures with AWS Lambda</a>. These show you best practices around using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda together when building your backend. This pattern is encoded into the <code>API</code> category of Amplify. You can use this pattern to interact with several different REST endpoints, and pass headers all the way through to your Lambda function for custom business logic. We\u2019ve also released an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/react-native-getting-started.html\">AWS Mobile CLI</a> for bootstrapping new or existing React Native projects with these features. To get started, just install via <strong>npm</strong>, and follow the configuration prompts:</p><pre><code>npm install --global awsmobile-cli awsmobile configure </code></pre><p>Another example of encoded best practices that is specific to the mobile ecosystem is password security. The default <code>Auth</code> category implementation leverages Amazon Cognito user pools for user registration and sign-in. This service implements <a href=\"http://srp.stanford.edu\">Secure Remote Password protocol</a> as a way of protecting users during authentication attempts. If you&#x27;re inclined to read through the <a href=\"http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00032200000000000000\">mathematics of the protocol</a>, you&#x27;ll notice that you must use a large prime number when calculating the password verifier over a primitive root to generate a Group. In React Native environments, <a href=\"/docs/javascript-environment\">JIT is disabled</a>. This makes BigInteger calculations for security operations such as this less performant. To account for this, we&#x27;ve released native bridges in Android and iOS that you can link inside your project:</p><pre><code>npm install --save aws-amplify-react-native react-native link amazon-cognito-identity-js </code></pre><p>We&#x27;re also excited to see that the Expo team has included this <a href=\"https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v25-0-0-is-now-available-714d10a8c3f7\">in their latest SDK</a> so that you can use Amplify without ejecting.</p><p>Finally, specific to React Native (and React) development, Amplify contains <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html\">higher order components (HOCs)</a> for easily wrapping functionality, such as for sign-up and sign-in to your app:</p><pre><code>import Amplify, { withAuthenticator } from &#x27;aws-amplify-react-native&#x27;; import aws_exports from &#x27;./aws-exports&#x27;; Amplify.configure(aws_exports); class App extends React.Component { ... } export default withAuthenticator(App); </code></pre><p>The underlying component is also provided as <code><Authenticator /></code>, which gives you full control to customize the UI. It also gives you some properties around managing the state of the user, such as if they&#x27;ve signed in or are waiting for MFA confirmation, and callbacks that you can fire when state changes.</p><p>Similarly, you&#x27;ll find general React components that you can use for different use cases. You can customize these to your needs, for example, to show all private images from Amazon S3 in the <code>Storage</code> module:</p><pre><code><S3Album level=\"private\" path={path} filter={(item) => /jpg/i.test(item.path)}/> </code></pre><p>You can control many of the component features via props, as shown earlier, with public or private storage options. There are even capabilities to automatically gather analytics when users interact with certain UI components:</p><pre><code>return <S3Album track/> </code></pre><p>AWS Amplify favors a convention over configuration style of development, with a global initialization routine or initialization at the category level. The quickest way to get started is with an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/enhanced-javascript-development-with-aws-mobile-hub/\">aws-exports file</a>. However, developers can also use the library independently with existing resources.</p><p>For a deep dive into the philosophy and to see a full demo, check out the video from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAjf3lyjf8c\">AWS re:Invent</a>.</p><h2>AWS AppSync</h2><p>Shortly after the launch of AWS Amplify, we also released <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/\">AWS AppSync</a>. This is a fully managed GraphQL service that has both offline and real-time capabilities. Although you can use GraphQL in different client programming languages (including native Android and iOS), it&#x27;s quite popular among React Native developers. This is because the data model fits nicely into a unidirectional data flow and component hierarchy.</p><p>AWS AppSync enables you to connect to resources in your own AWS account, meaning you own and control your data. This is done by using data sources, and the service supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/\">Amazon Elasticsearch</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a>. This enables you to combine functionality (such as NoSQL and full-text search) in a single GraphQL API as a schema. This enables you to mix and match data sources. The AppSync service can also <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/provision-from-schema.html\">provision from a schema</a>, so if you aren&#x27;t familiar with AWS services, you can write GraphQL SDL, click a button, and you&#x27;re automatically up and running.</p><p>The real-time functionality in AWS AppSync is controlled via <a href=\"http://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/\">GraphQL subscriptions with a well-known, event-based pattern</a>. Because subscriptions in AWS AppSync are <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/real-time-data.html\">controlled on the schema</a> with a GraphQL directive, and a schema can use any data source, this means you can trigger notifications from database operations with Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Elasticsearch Service, or from other parts of your infrastructure with AWS Lambda.</p><p>In a way similar to AWS Amplify, you can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security.html\">enterprise security features</a> on your GraphQL API with AWS AppSync. The service lets you get started quickly with API keys. However, as you roll to production it can transition to using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) or OIDC tokens from Amazon Cognito user pools. You can control access at the resolver level with policies on types. You can even use logical checks for <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security.html#fine-grained-access-control\">fine-grained access control</a> checks at run time, such as detecting if a user is the owner of a specific database resource. There are also capabilities around checking group membership for executing resolvers or individual database record access.</p><p>To help React Native developers learn more about these technologies, there is a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/quickstart.html\">built-in GraphQL sample schema</a> that you can launch on the AWS AppSync console homepage. This sample deploys a GraphQL schema, provisions database tables, and connects queries, mutations, and subscriptions automatically for you. There is also a functioning <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-mobile-appsync-events-starter-react-native\">React Native example for AWS AppSync</a> which leverages this built in schema (as well as a <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-mobile-appsync-events-starter-react\">React example</a>), which enable you to get both your client and cloud components running in minutes.</p><p>Getting started is simple when you use the <code>AWSAppSyncClient</code>, which plugs in to the <a href=\"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client\">Apollo Client</a>. The <code>AWSAppSyncClient</code> handles security and signing for your GraphQL API, offline functionality, and the subscription handshake and negotiation process:</p><pre><code>import AWSAppSyncClient from \"aws-appsync\"; import { Rehydrated } from &#x27;aws-appsync-react&#x27;; import { AUTH_TYPE } from \"aws-appsync/lib/link/auth-link\"; const client = new AWSAppSyncClient({ url: awsconfig.graphqlEndpoint, region: awsconfig.region, auth: {type: AUTH_TYPE.API_KEY, apiKey: awsconfig.apiKey} }); </code></pre><p>The AppSync console provides a configuration file for download, which contains your GraphQL endpoint, AWS Region, and API key. You can then use the client with <a href=\"https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo\">React Apollo</a>:</p><pre><code>const WithProvider = () => ( <ApolloProvider client={client}> <Rehydrated> <App /> </Rehydrated> </ApolloProvider> ); </code></pre><p>At this point, you can use standard GraphQL queries:</p><pre><code>query ListEvents { listEvents{ items{ __typename id name where when description comments{ __typename items{ __typename eventId commentId content createdAt } nextToken } } } } </code></pre><p>The example above shows a query with the sample app schema provisioned by AppSync. It not only showcases interaction with DynamoDB, but also includes pagination of data (including encrypted tokens) and type relations between <code>Events</code> and <code>Comments</code>. Because the app is configured with the <code>AWSAppSyncClient</code>, data is automatically persisted offline and will synchronize when devices reconnect.</p><p>You can see a deep dive of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtkVlIal_m0\">client technology behind this and a React Native demo in this video</a>.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FtkVlIal_m0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"></iframe><h2>Feedback</h2><p>The team behind the libraries is eager to hear how these libraries and services work for you.

This approach doesn\u2019t work because the Twitter bird becoming transparent would show the blue layer, not the app underneath!</p><p>Luckily for you, dear reader, you don\u2019t have to go through the same frustration I did. You get this nice tutorial skipping to the good stuff!</p><hr style=\"clear:both;margin-bottom:40px;width:80px\"/><h2>The right way</h2><p>Before we get to code, it is important to understand how to break this down. To help visualize this effect, I recreated it in <a href=\"https://codepen.io/TheSavior/pen/NXNoJM\">CodePen</a> (embedded in a few paragraphs) so you can interactively see the different layers.</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/loading-screen-03.png\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:80px;padding-bottom:20px\"/><p>There are three main layers to this effect. The first is the blue background layer. Even though this seems to appear on top of the app, it is actually in the back.</p><p>We then have a plain white layer. And then lastly, in the very front, is our app.</p><hr style=\"clear:both;margin-bottom:40px;width:80px\"/><img src=\"/blog/assets/loading-screen-04.png\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:80px;padding-bottom:20px\"/><p>The main trick to this animation is using the Twitter logo as a <code>mask</code> and masking both the app, and the white layer. I won\u2019t go too deep on the details of masking, there are <a href=\"https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/\">plenty</a> of <a href=\"https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-masking-in-photoshop/\">resources</a> <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/shapes/masking/\">online</a> for that.</p><p>The basics of masking in this context are having images where opaque pixels of the mask show the content they are masking whereas transparent pixels of the mask hide the content they are masking.</p><p>We use the Twitter logo as a mask, and having it mask two layers; the solid white layer, and the app layer.</p><p>To reveal the app, we scale the mask up until it is larger than the entire screen.</p><p>While the mask is scaling up, we fade in the opacity of the app layer, showing the app and hiding the solid white layer behind it. To finish the effect, we start the app layer at a scale > 1, and scale it down to 1 as the animation is ending. We then hide the non-app layers as they will never be seen again.</p><p>They say a picture is worth 1,000 words. How many words is an interactive visualization worth? Click through the animation with the \u201CNext Step\u201D button. Showing the layers gives you a side view perspective. The grid is there to help visualize the transparent layers.</p><iframe height=\"750\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Loading Screen Animation Steps\" src=\"//codepen.io/TheSavior/embed/NXNoJM/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=result&embed-version=2\" frameborder=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen<!-- --> <a href=\"https://codepen.io/TheSavior/pen/NXNoJM/\">Loading Screen Animation Steps</a> <!-- -->by Eli White ( <a href=\"https://codepen.io/TheSavior\">@TheSavior</a>) on<!-- --> <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</iframe><h2>Now, for the React Native</h2><p>Alrighty. Now that we know what we are building and how the animation works, we can get down to the code \u2014 the reason you are really here.</p><p>The main piece of this puzzle is <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.63/maskedviewios\">MaskedViewIOS</a>, a core React Native component.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import { MaskedViewIOS } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; <MaskedViewIOS maskElement={<Text>Basic Mask</Text>}> <View style={{ backgroundColor: &#x27;blue&#x27; }} /> </MaskedViewIOS>; </code></pre><p><code>MaskedViewIOS</code> takes props <code>maskElement</code> and <code>children</code>. The children are masked by the <code>maskElement</code>. Note that the mask doesn\u2019t need to be an image, it can be any arbitrary view. The behavior of the above example would be to render the blue view, but for it to be visible only where the words \u201CBasic Mask\u201D are from the <code>maskElement</code>. We just made complicated blue text.</p><p>What we want to do is render our blue layer, and then on top render our masked app and white layers with the Twitter logo.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">{ fullScreenBlueLayer; } <MaskedViewIOS style={{ flex: 1 }} maskElement={ <View style={styles.centeredFullScreen}> <Image source={twitterLogo} /> </View> }> {fullScreenWhiteLayer} <View style={{ flex: 1 }}> <MyApp /> </View> </MaskedViewIOS>; </code></pre><p>This will give us the layers we see below.</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/loading-screen-04.png\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block\"/><h2>Now for the Animated part</h2><p>We have all the pieces we need to make this work, the next step is animating them. To make this animation feel good, we will be utilizing React Native\u2019s <a href=\"/docs/animated\">Animated</a> API.</p><p>Animated lets us define our animations declaratively in JavaScript. By default, these animations run in JavaScript and tell the native layer what changes to make on every frame. Even though JavaScript will try to update the animation every frame, it will likely not be able to do that fast enough and will cause dropped frames (jank) to occur. Not what we want!</p><p>Animated has special behavior to allow you to get animations without this jank. Animated has a flag called <code>useNativeDriver</code> which sends your animation definition from JavaScript to native at the beginning of your animation, allowing the native side to process the updates to your animation without having to go back and forth to JavaScript every frame. The downside of <code>useNativeDriver</code> is you can only update a specific set of properties, mostly <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code>. You can\u2019t animate things like background color with <code>useNativeDriver</code>, at least not yet \u2014 we will add more over time, and of course you can always submit a PR for properties you need for your project, benefitting the whole community ð.</p><p>Since we want this animation to be smooth, we will work within these constraints. For a more in depth look at how <code>useNativeDriver</code> works under the hood, check out our <a href=\"/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated\">blog post announcing it</a>.</p><h2>Breaking down our animation</h2><p>There are 4 components to our animation:</p><ol><li>Enlarge the bird, revealing the app and the solid white layer</li><li>Fade in the app</li><li>Scale down the app</li><li>Hide the white layer and blue layer when it is done</li></ol><p>With Animated, there are two main ways to define your animation. The first is by using <code>Animated.timing</code> which lets you say exactly how long your animation will run for, along with an easing curve to smooth out the motion. The other approach is by using the physics based apis such as <code>Animated.spring</code>. With <code>Animated.spring</code>, you specify parameters like the amount of friction and tension in the spring, and let physics run your animation.</p><p>We have multiple animations we want to be running at the same time which are all closely related to each other. For example, we want the app to start fading in while the mask is mid-reveal. Because these animations are closely related, we will use <code>Animated.timing</code> with a single <code>Animated.Value</code>.</p><p><code>Animated.Value</code> is a wrapper around a native value that Animated uses to know the state of an animation. You typically want to only have one of these for a complete animation. Most components that use Animated will store the value in state.</p><p>Since I\u2019m thinking about this animation as steps occurring at different points in time along the complete animation, we will start our <code>Animated.Value</code> at 0, representing 0% complete, and end our value at 100, representing 100% complete.</p><p>Our initial component state will be the following.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">state = { loadingProgress: new Animated.Value(0) }; </code></pre><p>When we are ready to begin the animation, we tell Animated to animate this value to 100.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">Animated.timing(this.state.loadingProgress, { toValue: 100, duration: 1000, useNativeDriver: true // This is important! }).start(); </code></pre><p>I then try to figure out a rough estimate of the different pieces of the animations and the values I want them to have at different stages of the overall animation. Below is a table of the different pieces of the animation, and what I think their values should be at different points as we progress through time.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/loading-screen-05.png\"/></p><p>The Twitter bird mask should start at scale 1, and it gets smaller before it shoots up in size. So at 10% through the animation, it should have a scale value of .8 before shooting up to scale 70 at the end. Picking 70 was pretty arbitrary to be honest, it needed to be large enough that the bird fully revealed the screen and 60 wasn\u2019t big enough ð. Something interesting about this part though is that the higher the number, the faster it will look like it is growing because it has to get there in the same amount of time. This number took some trial and error to make look good with this logo. Logos / devices of different sizes will require this end-scale to be different to ensure the entire screen is revealed.</p><p>The app should stay opaque for a while, at least through the Twitter logo getting smaller. Based on the official animation, I want to start showing it when the bird is mid way through scaling it up and to fully reveal it pretty quickly. So at 15% we start showing it, and at 30% through the overall animation it is fully visible.</p><p>The app scale starts at 1.1 and scales down to its regular scale by the end of the animation.</p><h2>And now, in code.</h2><p>What we essentially did above is map the values from the animation progress percentage to the values for the individual pieces. We do that with Animated using <code>.interpolate</code>. We create 3 different style objects, one for each piece of the animation, using interpolated values based off of <code>this.state.loadingProgress</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const loadingProgress = this.state.loadingProgress; const opacityClearToVisible = { opacity: loadingProgress.interpolate({ inputRange: [0, 15, 30], outputRange: [0, 0, 1], extrapolate: &#x27;clamp&#x27; // clamp means when the input is 30-100, output should stay at 1 }) }; const imageScale = { transform: [ { scale: loadingProgress.interpolate({ inputRange: [0, 10, 100], outputRange: [1, 0.8, 70] }) } ] }; const appScale = { transform: [ { scale: loadingProgress.interpolate({ inputRange: [0, 100], outputRange: [1.1, 1] }) } ] }; </code></pre><p>Now that we have these style objects, we can use them when rendering the snippet of the view from earlier in the post. Note that only <code>Animated.View</code>, <code>Animated.Text</code>, and <code>Animated.Image</code> are able to use style objects that use <code>Animated.Value</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const fullScreenBlueLayer = ( <View style={styles.fullScreenBlueLayer} /> ); const fullScreenWhiteLayer = ( <View style={styles.fullScreenWhiteLayer} /> ); return ( <View style={styles.fullScreen}> {fullScreenBlueLayer} <MaskedViewIOS style={{ flex: 1 }} maskElement={ <View style={styles.centeredFullScreen}> <Animated.Image style={[styles.maskImageStyle, imageScale]} source={twitterLogo} /> </View> }> {fullScreenWhiteLayer} <Animated.View style={[opacityClearToVisible, appScale, { flex: 1 }]}> {this.props.children} </Animated.View> </MaskedViewIOS> </View> ); </code></pre><img src=\"/blog/assets/loading-screen-06.gif\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:80px;padding-bottom:20px\"/><p>Yay! We now have the animation pieces looking like we want. Now we just have to clean up our blue and white layers which will never be seen again.</p><p>To know when we can clean them up, we need to know when the animation is complete. Luckily where we call, <code>Animated.timing</code> ,<code>.start</code> takes an optional callback that runs when the animation is complete.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">Animated.timing(this.state.loadingProgress, { toValue: 100, duration: 1000, useNativeDriver: true }).start(() => { this.setState({ animationDone: true }); }); </code></pre><p>Now that we have a value in <code>state</code> to know whether we are done with the animation, we can modify our blue and white layers to use that.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const fullScreenBlueLayer = this.state.animationDone ? null : ( <View style={[styles.fullScreenBlueLayer]} /> ); const fullScreenWhiteLayer = this.state.animationDone ? null : ( <View style={[styles.fullScreenWhiteLayer]} /> ); </code></pre><p>Voila! Our animation now works and we clean up our unused layers once the animation is done. We have built the Twitter app loading animation!</p><h2>But wait, mine doesn\u2019t work!</h2><p>Don\u2019t fret, dear reader. I too hate when guides only give you chunks of the code and don\u2019t give you the completed source.</p><p>This component has been published to npm and is on GitHub as <a href=\"https://github.com/TheSavior/react-native-mask-loader\">react-native-mask-loader</a>. To try this out on your phone, it is <a href=\"https://expo.io/@eliwhite/react-native-mask-loader-example\">available on Expo</a> here:</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/loading-screen-07.png\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block\"/><h2>More Reading / Extra Credit</h2><ol><li><a href=\"http://browniefed.com/react-native-animation-book/\">This gitbook</a> is a great resource to learn more about Animated after you have read the React Native docs.</li><li>The actual Twitter animation seems to speed up the mask reveal towards the end. Try modifying the loader to use a different easing function (or a spring!) to better match that behavior.</li><li>The current end-scale of the mask is hard coded and likely won\u2019t reveal the entire app on a tablet. Calculating the end scale based on screen size and image size would be an awesome PR.</li></ol> "

You can try those apps out on <a href=\"https://www.fullstackreact.com/react-native/\">https://www.fullstackreact.com/react-native/</a> before buying the book.</li><li>Released a first (experimental) version of <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/reason-react-native-scripts\">reason-react-native-scripts</a> to help people to easily try out <a href=\"https://reasonml.github.io/\">ReasonML</a>.</li><li>Expo SDK 24 is <a href=\"https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v24-0-0-is-now-available-bfcac3b50d51\">released</a>! It uses <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.51.0\">React Native 0.51</a> and includes a bunch of new features and improvements: bundling images in standalone apps (no need to cache on first load!), image manipulation API (crop, resize, rotate, flip), face detection API, new release channel features (set the active release for a given channel and rollback), web dashboard to track standalone app builds, and a fix longstanding bug with OpenGL Android implementation and the Android multi-tasker, just to name a few things.</li><li>We are allocating more resources to React Navigation starting this January. We strongly believe that it is both possible and desirable to build React Native navigation with just React components and primitives like Animated and <code>react-native-gesture-handler</code> and we\u2019re really excited about some of the improvements we have planned. If you&#x27;re looking to contribute to the community, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps\">react-native-maps</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg\">react-native-svg</a>, which could both use some help!</li></ul><h3>Infinite Red</h3><ul><li>We have our Keynote speakers for <a href=\"https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf\">Chain React conf</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds\">Kent C. Dodds</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyleet\">Tracy Lee</a>. We will be opening CFP very soon.</li><li><a href=\"http://community.infinite.red/\">Community chat</a> now at 1600 people.</li><li><a href=\"http://reactnative.cc/\">React Native Newsletter</a> now at 8500 subscribers.</li><li>Currently researching best practice for making RN crash resistant, reports to follow.</li><li>Adding ability to report from <a href=\"https://shift.infinite.red/effortless-environment-reports-d129d53eb405\">Solidarity</a>.</li><li>Published a HOW-TO for releasing on <a href=\"https://shift.infinite.red/simple-react-native-android-releases-319dc5e29605\">React Native and Android</a>.</li></ul><h3>Microsoft</h3><ul><li>A <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows/pull/1419\">pull request</a> has been started to migrate the core React Native Windows bridge to .NET Standard, making it effectively OS-agnostic. The hope is that many other .NET Core platforms can extend the bridge with their own threading models, JavaScript runtimes, and UIManagers (think JavaScriptCore, Xamarin.Mac, Linux Gtk#, and Samsung Tizen options).</li></ul><h3>Wix</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wix/detox\">Detox</a><ul><li>In order for us to scale with E2E tests, we want to minimize time spent on CI, we are working on parallelization support for Detox.</li><li>Submitted a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/16948\">pull request</a> to enable support for custom flavor builds, to better support mocking on E2E.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments\">DetoxInstruments</a><ul><li>Working on the killer feature of DetoxInstruments proves to be a very challenging task, taking JavaScript backtrace at any given time requires a custom JSCore implementation to support JS thread suspension. Testing the profiler internally on Wix\u2019s app revealed interesting insights about the JS thread.</li><li>The project is still not stable enough for general use but is actively worked on, and we hope to announce it soon.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation\">React Native Navigation</a><ul><li>V2 development pace has been increased substantially, up until now, we only had 1 developer working on it 20% of his time, we now have 3 developers working on it full time!</li></ul></li><li>Android Performance<ul><li>Replacing the old JSCore bundled in RN with its newest version (tip of webkitGTK project, with custom JIT configuration) produced 40% performance increase on the JS thread. Next up is compiling a 64bit version of it. This effort is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/SoftwareMansion/jsc-android-buildscripts\">JSC build scripts for Android</a>. Follow its current status <a href=\"https://github.com/DanielZlotin/jsc-android-buildscripts/tree/tip\">here</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Next sessions</h2><p>There&#x27;s been some discussion on re-purposing this meeting to discuss a single and specific topic (e.g. navigation, moving React Native modules into separate repos, documentation, ...). That way we feel we can contribute the best to React Native community. It might take place in the next meeting session. Feel free to tweet what you&#x27;d like to see covered as a topic.</p> "

Most importantly, we have migrated from Travis to Circle, leaving React Native with a single, unified CI pipeline.</li><li>We\u2019ve organised <a href=\"https://blog.callstack.io/announcing-hacktoberfest-7313ea5ccf4f\">Hacktoberfest - React Native edition</a> where, together with attendees, we tried to submit many pull requests to open source projects.</li><li>We keep working on <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack/haul\">Haul</a>. Last month, we have submitted two new releases, including Webpack 3 support. We plan to add <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app\">CRNA</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/expo/expo\">Expo</a> support as well as work on better HMR. Our roadmap is public on the issue tracker. If you would like to suggest improvements or give feedback, let us know!</li></ul><h3>Expo</h3><ul><li>Released <a href=\"https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v22-0-0-is-now-available-7745bfe97fc6\">Expo SDK 22</a> (using React Native 0.49) and updated <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app\">CRNA</a> for it.<ul><li>Includes improved splash screen API, basic ARKit support, \u201CDeviceMotion\u201D API, SFAuthenticationSession support on iOS11, and <a href=\"https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v22-0-0-is-now-available-7745bfe97fc6\">more</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Your <a href=\"https://snack.expo.io\">snacks</a> can now have multiple JavaScript files and you can upload images and other assets by just dragging them into the editor.</li><li>Contribute to <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation\">react-navigation</a> to add support for iPhone X.</li><li>Focus our attention on rough edges when building large applications with Expo. For example:<ul><li>First-class support for deploying to multiple environments: staging, production, and arbitrary channels. Channels will support rolling back and setting the active release for a given channel. Let us know if you want to be an early tester, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/expo_io\">@expo_io</a>.</li><li>We are also working on improving our standalone app building infrastructure and adding support for bundling images and other non-code assets in standalone app builds while keeping the ability to update assets over the air.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Facebook</h3><ul><li>Better RTL support:<ul><li>We\u2019re introducing a number of direction-aware styles.<ul><li>Position:<ul><li>(left|right) â (start|end)</li></ul></li><li>Margin:<ul><li>margin(Left|Right) â margin(Start|End)</li></ul></li><li>Padding:<ul><li>padding(Left|Right) â padding(Start|End)</li></ul></li><li>Border:<ul><li>borderTop(Left|Right)Radius â borderTop(Start|End)Radius</li><li>borderBottom(Left|Right)Radius â borderBottom(Start|End)Radius</li><li>border(Left|Right)Width â border(Start|End)Width</li><li>border(Left|Right)Color â border(Start|End)Color</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The meaning of \u201Cleft\u201D and \u201Cright\u201D were swapped in RTL for position, margin, padding, and border styles. Within a few months, we\u2019re going to remove this behaviour and make \u201Cleft\u201D always mean \u201Cleft,\u201D and \u201Cright\u201D always mean \u201Cright\u201D. The breaking changes are hidden under a flag. Use <code>I18nManager.swapLeftAndRightInRTL(false)</code> in your React Native components to opt into them.</li></ul></li><li>Working on <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/flow\">Flow</a> typing our internal native modules and using those to generate interfaces in Java and protocols in ObjC that the native implementations must implement. We hope this codegen becomes open source next year, at the earliest.</li></ul><h3>Infinite Red</h3><ul><li>New OSS tool for helping React Native and other projects. More <a href=\"https://shift.infinite.red/solidarity-the-cli-for-developer-sanity-672fa81b98e9\">here</a>.</li><li>Revamping <a href=\"https://github.com/infinitered/ignite\">Ignite</a> for a new boilerplate release (Code name: Bowser)</li></ul><h3>Shoutem</h3><ul><li>Improving the development flow on Shoutem. We want to streamline the process from creating an app to first custom screen and make it really easy, thus lowering the barrier for new React Native developers. Prepared a few workshops to test out new features. We also improved <a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/cli\">Shoutem CLI</a> to support new flows.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/ui\">Shoutem UI</a> received a few component improvements and bugfixes. We also checked compatibility with latest React Native versions.</li><li>Shoutem platform received a few notable updates, new integrations are available as part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/extensions\">open-source extensions project</a>. We are really excited to see active development on Shoutem extensions from other developers. We actively contact and offer advice and guidance about their extensions.</li></ul><h2>Next session</h2><p>The next session is scheduled for Wednesday 6, December 2017. Feel free to ping me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomislavTenodi\">on Twitter</a> if you have any suggestion on how we should improve the output of the meeting.</p> "

Here are the notes from each team:</p><h3>Callstack</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://react-native.eu\">React Native EU</a> is over. More than 300 participants from 33 countries have visited Wroclaw. Talks can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUNE_g1mQPuyW975WjgjYxA/videos\">on Youtube</a>.</li><li>We are slowly getting back to our open source schedule after the conference. One thing worth mentioning is that we are working on a next release of <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack/react-native-opentok\">react-native-opentok</a> that fixes most of the existing issues.</li></ul><h3>GeekyAnts</h3><p>Trying to lower the entry barrier for the developers embracing React Native with the following things:</p><ul><li>Announced <a href=\"https://builderx.io/\">BuilderX.io</a> at <a href=\"https://react-native.eu\">React Native EU</a>. BuilderX is a design tool that directly works with JavaScript files (only React Native is supported at the moment) to generate beautiful, readable, and editable code.</li><li>Launched <a href=\"http://reactnativeseed.com/\">ReactNativeSeed.com</a> which provides a set of boilerplates for your next React Native project. It comes with a variety of options that include TypeScript & Flow for data-types, MobX, Redux, and mobx-state-tree for state-management with CRNA and plain React-Native as the stack.</li></ul><h3>Expo</h3><ul><li>Will release SDK 21 shortly, which adds support for react-native 0.48.3 and a bunch of bugfixes/reliability improvements/new features in the Expo SDK, including video recording, a new splash screen API, support for <code>react-native-gesture-handler</code>, and improved error handling.</li><li>Re: <a href=\"https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler\">react-native-gesture-handler</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kmagiera\">Krzysztof Magiera</a> of <a href=\"http://swmansion.com/\">Software Mansion</a> continues pushing this forward and we&#x27;ve been helping him with testing it and funding part of his development time. Having this integrated in Expo in SDK21 will allow people to play with it easily in Snack, so we&#x27;re excited to see what people come up with.</li><li>Re: improved error logging / handling - see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/00407710a854627aa021fdf90490b958\">this gist of an internal Expo PR</a> for details on logging, (in particular, \"Problem 2\"), and <a href=\"https://github.com/expo/xdl/commit/1d62eca293dfb867fc0afc920c3dad94b7209987\">this commit</a> for a change that handles failed attempts to import npm standard library modules. There is plenty of opportunity to improve error messages upstream in React Native in this way and we will work on follow up upstream PRs. It would be great for the community to get involved too.</li><li><a href=\"http://native.directory/\">native.directory</a> continues to grow, you can add your projects from <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/native-directory\">the Github repo</a>.</li><li>Visit hackathons around North America, including <a href=\"http://pennapps.com/\">PennApps</a>, <a href=\"http://hackthenorth.com/\">Hack The North</a>, <a href=\"https://hackmit.org/\">HackMIT</a>, and soon <a href=\"https://mhacks.org/\">MHacks</a>.</li></ul><h3>Facebook</h3><ul><li>Working on improving <code><Text></code> and <code><TextInput></code> components on Android. (Native auto-growing for <code><TextInput></code>; deeply nested <code><Text></code> components layout issues; better code structure; performance optimizations).</li><li>We&#x27;re still looking for additional contributors who would like to help triage issues and pull requests.</li></ul><h3>Microsoft</h3><ul><li>Released Code Signing feature for CodePush. React Native developers are now able to sign their application bundles in CodePush. The announcement can be found <a href=\"http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/articles/CodeSigningAnnouncement.html\">here</a></li><li>Working on completing integration of CodePush to Mobile Center. Considering test/crash integration as well.</li></ul><h2>Next session</h2><p>The next session is scheduled for Wednesday 10, October 2017. As this was only our fourth meeting, we&#x27;d like to know how do these notes benefit the React Native community. Feel free to ping me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grabbou\">on Twitter</a> if you have any suggestion on how we should improve the output of the meeting.</p> "

Next month, we are at <a href=\"https://react-native.eu/\">React Native EU</a> conference in Wroclaw, Poland. Make sure to grab a ticket and see you there in person! Meanwhile, let&#x27;s see what our teams are up to.</p><h2>Teams</h2><p>On this third meeting, we had 5 teams join us:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/callstack\">Callstack</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/expo\">Expo</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft\">Microsoft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem\">Shoutem</a></li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><p>Here are the notes from each team:</p><h3>Callstack</h3><ul><li>Recently open sourced <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack-io/react-native-material-palette\"><code>react-native-material-palette</code></a>. It extracts prominent colors from images to help you create visually engaging apps. It&#x27;s Android only at the moment, but we are looking into adding support for iOS in the future.</li><li>We have landed HMR support into <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack-io/haul\"><code>haul</code></a> and a bunch of other, cool stuff! Check out latest releases.</li><li>React Native EU 2017 is coming! Next month is all about React Native and Poland! Make sure to grab last tickets available <a href=\"https://react-native.eu/\">here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Expo</h3><ul><li>Released support for installing npm packages on <a href=\"https://snack.expo.io\">Snack</a>. Usual Expo restrictions apply -- packages can&#x27;t depend on custom native APIs that aren&#x27;t already included in Expo. We are also working on supporting multiple files and uploading assets in Snack. <a href=\"https://github.com/satya164\">Satyajit</a> will talk about Snack at <a href=\"https://react-native.eu/\">React Native Europe</a>.</li><li>Released SDK20 with camera, payments, secure storage, magnetometer, pause/resume fs downloads, and improved splash/loading screen.</li><li>Continuing to work with <a href=\"https://github.com/kmagiera\">Krzysztof</a> on <a href=\"https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler\">react-native-gesture-handler</a>. Please give it a try, rebuild some gesture that you have previously built using PanResponder or native gesture recognizers and let us know what issues you encounter.</li><li>Experimenting with JSC debugging protocol, working on a bunch of feature requests on <a href=\"https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests\">Canny</a>.</li></ul><h3>Facebook</h3><ul><li>Last month we discussed management of the GitHub issue tracker and that we would try to make improvements to address the maintainability of the project.</li><li>Currently, the number of open issues is holding steady at around 600, and it seems like it may stay that way for a while. In the past month, we have closed 690 issues due to lack of activity (defined as no comments in the last 60 days). Out of those 690 issues, 58 were re-opened for a variety of reasons (a maintainer committed to providing a fix, or a contributor made a great case for keeping the issue open).</li><li>We plan to continue with the automated closing of stale issues for the foreseeable future. We\u2019d like to be in a state where every impactful issue opened in the tracker is acted upon, but we\u2019re not there yet. We need all the help we can from maintainers to triage issues and make sure we don&#x27;t miss issues that introduce regressions or introduce breaking changes, especially those that affect newly created projects. People interested in helping out can use the Facebook GitHub Bot to triage issues and pull requests. The new Maintainers Guide contains more information on triage and use of the GitHub Bot. Please add yourself to the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/bots/IssueCommands.txt\">issue task force</a> and encourage other active community members to do the same!</li></ul><h3>Microsoft</h3><ul><li>The new Skype app is built on top of React Native in order to facilitate sharing as much code between platforms as possible. The React Native-based Skype app is currently available in the Android and iOS app stores.</li><li>While building the Skype app on React Native, we send pull requests to React Native in order to address bugs and missing features that we come across. So far, we&#x27;ve gotten about <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Arigdern%20\">70 pull requests merged</a>.</li><li>React Native enabled us to power both the Android and iOS Skype apps from the same codebase. We also want to use that codebase to power the Skype web app. To help us achieve that goal, we built and open sourced a thin layer on top of React/React Native called <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/blog/2017/04/06/introducing-reactxp.html\">ReactXP</a>. ReactXP provides a set of cross platform components that get mapped to React Native when targeting iOS/Android and to react-dom when targeting the web. ReactXP&#x27;s goals are similar to another open source library called React Native for Web. There&#x27;s a brief description of how the approaches of these libraries differ in the <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/docs/faq.html\">ReactXP FAQ</a>.</li></ul><h3>Shoutem</h3><ul><li>We are continuing our efforts on improving and simplifying the developer experience when building apps using <a href=\"https://shoutem.github.io/\">Shoutem</a>.</li><li>Started migrating all our apps to react-navigation, but we ended postponing this until a more stable version is released, or one of the native navigation solutions becomes stable.</li><li>Updating all our <a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/extensions\">extensions</a> and most of our open source libraries (<a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/animation\">animation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/theme\">theme</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/ui\">ui</a>) to React Native 0.47.1.</li></ul><h2>Next session</h2><p>The next session is scheduled for Wednesday 13, September 2017. As this was only our third meeting, we&#x27;d like to know how do these notes benefit the React Native community. Feel free to ping me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grabbou\">on Twitter</a> if you have any suggestion on how we should improve the output of the meeting.</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>React Native is used in multiple places across multiple apps in the Facebook family including a top level tab in the main Facebook apps. Our focus for this post is a highly visible product, <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/10/introducing-marketplace-buy-and-sell-with-your-local-community/\">Marketplace</a>. It is available in a dozen or so countries and enables users to discover products and services provided by other users.</p><p>In the first half of 2017, through the joint effort of the Relay Team, the Marketplace team, the Mobile JS Platform team, and the React Native team, we cut Marketplace Time to Interaction (TTI) in half for Android <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/307478339448736/year-class-a-classification-system-for-android/\">Year Class 2010-11 devices</a>. Facebook has historically considered these devices as low-end Android devices, and they have the slowest TTIs on any platform or device type.</p><p>A typical React Native startup looks something like this:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/RNPerformanceStartup.png\"/></p><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: ratios aren&#x27;t representative and will vary depending on how React Native is configured and used.</p></blockquote><p>We first initialize the React Native core (aka the \u201CBridge\u201D) before running the product specific JavaScript which determines what native views React Native will render in the Native Processing Time.</p><h3>A different approach</h3><p>One of the earlier mistakes that we made was to let <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/747457662026706/performance-instrumentation-for-android-apps/\">Systrace and CTScan</a> drive our performance efforts. These tools helped us find a lot of low-hanging fruit in 2016, but we discovered that both Systrace and CTScan are <strong>not representative of production scenarios</strong> and cannot emulate what happens in the wild. Ratios of time spent in the breakdowns are often incorrect and, wildly off-base at times. At the extreme, some things that we expected to take a few milliseconds actually take hundreds or thousands of milliseconds. That said, CTScan is useful and we&#x27;ve found it catches a third of regressions before they hit production.</p><p>On Android, we attribute the shortcomings of these tools to the fact that 1) React Native is a multithreaded framework, 2) Marketplace is co-located with a multitude of complex views such as Newsfeed and other top-level tabs, and 3) computation times vary wildly. Thus, this half, we let production measurements and breakdowns drive almost all of our decision making and prioritization.</p><h3>Down the path of production instrumentation</h3><p>Instrumenting production may sound simple on the surface, but it turned out to be quite a complex process. It took multiple iteration cycles of 2-3 weeks each; due to the latency of landing a commit in master, to pushing the app to the Play Store, to gathering sufficient production samples to have confidence in our work. Each iteration cycle involved discovering if our breakdowns were accurate, if they had the right level of granularity, and if they properly added up to the whole time span. We could not rely on alpha and beta releases because they are not representative of the general population. In essence, we very tediously built a very accurate production trace based on the aggregate of millions of samples.</p><p>One of the reasons we meticulously verified that every millisecond in breakdowns properly added up to their parent metrics was that we realized early on there were gaps in our instrumentation. It turned out that our initial breakdowns did not account for stalls caused by thread jumps. Thread jumps themselves aren&#x27;t expensive, but thread jumps to busy threads already doing work are very expensive. We eventually reproduced these blockages locally by sprinkling <code>Thread.sleep()</code> calls at the right moments, and we managed to fix them by:</p><ol><li>removing our dependency on AsyncTask,</li><li>undoing the forced initialization of ReactContext and NativeModules on the UI thread, and</li><li>removing the dependency on measuring the ReactRootView at initialization time.</li></ol><p>Together, removing these thread blockage issues reduced the startup time by over 25%.</p><p>Production metrics also challenged some of our prior assumptions. For example, we used to pre-load many JavaScript modules on the startup path under the assumption that co-locating modules in one bundle would reduce their initialization cost. However, the cost of pre-loading and co-locating these modules far outweighed the benefits. By re-configuring our inline require blacklists and removing JavaScript modules from the startup path, we were able to avoid loading unnecessary modules such as Relay Classic (when only <a href=\"https://relay.dev/docs/new-in-relay-modern\">Relay Modern</a> was necessary). Today, our <code>RUN_JS_BUNDLE</code> breakdown is over 75% faster.</p><p>We also found wins by investigating product-specific native modules. For example, by lazily injecting a native module&#x27;s dependencies, we reduced that native module&#x27;s cost by 98%. By removing the contention of Marketplace startup with other products, we reduced startup by an equivalent interval.</p><p>The best part is that many of these improvements are broadly applicable to all screens built with React Native.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>People assume that React Native startup performance problems are caused by JavaScript being slow or exceedingly high network times. While speeding up things like JavaScript would bring down TTI by a non-trivial sum, each of these contribute a much smaller percentage of TTI than was previously believed.</p><p>The lesson so far has been to <em>measure, measure, measure!</em> Some wins come from moving run-time costs to build time, such as Relay Modern and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/797ca6c219b2a44f88f10c61d91e8cc21e2f306e\">Lazy NativeModules</a>. Other wins come from avoiding work by being smarter about parallelizing code or removing dead code. And some wins come from large architectural changes to React Native, such as cleaning up thread blockages. There is no grand solution to performance, and longer-term performance wins will come from incremental instrumentation and improvements. Do not let cognitive bias influence your decisions. Instead, carefully gather and interpret production data to guide future work.</p><h2>Future plans</h2><p>In the long term, we want Marketplace TTI to be comparable to similar products built with Native, and, in general, have React Native performance on par with native performance. Further more, although this half we drastically reduced the bridge startup cost by about 80%, we plan to bring the cost of the React Native bridge close to zero via projects like <a href=\"https://prepack.io/\">Prepack</a> and more build time processing.</p> "

On this session, we were joined by <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a>, great minds behind <a href=\"https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf\">Chain React, the React Native Conference</a>. As most of the people here were presenting talks at Chain React, we pushed the meeting to a week later. Talks from the conference have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHvL21g9bk3RxJ1Ut5nR_uTZFVOxu522\">posted online</a> and I encourage you to check them out. So, let&#x27;s see what our teams are up to.</p><h2>Teams</h2><p>On this second meeting, we had 9 teams join us:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb\">Airbnb</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/callstack-io\">Callstack</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/expo\">Expo</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/GeekyAnts\">GeekyAnts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/infinitered\">Infinite Red</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft\">Microsoft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem\">Shoutem</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wix\">Wix</a></li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><p>Here are the notes from each team:</p><h3>Airbnb</h3><ul><li>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb\">Airbnb repository</a> for React Native related projects.</li></ul><h3>Callstack</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/grabbou\">Mike Grabowski</a> has been managing React Native&#x27;s monthly releases as always, including a few betas that were pushed out. In particular, working on getting a v0.43.5 build published to npm since it unblocks Windows users!</li><li>Slow but consistent work is happening on <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack-io/haul\">Haul</a>. There is a pull request that adds HMR, and other improvements have shipped. Recently got a few industry leaders to adopt it. Possibly planning to start a full-time paid work in that area.</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thymikee\">MichaÅ PierzchaÅa</a> from the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/jest\">Jest</a> team has joined us at Callstack this month. He will help maintain <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack-io/haul\">Haul</a> and possibly work on <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro\">Metro Bundler</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/jest\">Jest</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/satya164\">Satyajit Sahoo</a> is now with us, yay!</li><li>Got a bunch of cool stuff coming up from our OSS department. In particular, working on bringing Material Palette API to React Native. Planning to finally release our native iOS kit which is aimed to provide 1:1 look & feel of native components.</li></ul><h3>Expo</h3><ul><li>Recently launched <a href=\"https://native.directory\">Native Directory</a> to help with discoverability and evaluation of libraries in React Native ecosystem. The problem: lots of libraries, hard to test, need to manually apply heuristics and not immediately obvious which ones are just the best ones that you should use. It&#x27;s also hard to know if something is compatible with CRNA/Expo. So Native Directory tries to solve these problems. Check it out and <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/native-directory\">add your library</a> to it. The list of libraries is in <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/native-directory/blob/master/react-native-libraries.json\">here</a>. This is just our first pass of it, and we want this to be owned and run by the community, not just Expo folks. So please pitch in if you think this is valuable and want to make it better!</li><li>Added initial support for installing npm packages in <a href=\"https://snack.expo.io/\">Snack</a> with Expo SDK 19. Let us know if you run into any issues with it, we are still working through some bugs. Along with Native Directory, this should make it easy to test libraries that have only JS dependencies, or dependencies included in <a href=\"https://github.com/expo/expo-sdk\">Expo SDK</a>. Try it out:<ul><li><a href=\"https://snack.expo.io/ByBCD_2r-\">react-native-modal</a></li><li><a href=\"https://snack.expo.io/SJfJguhrW\">react-native-animatable</a></li><li><a href=\"https://snack.expo.io/HkoXUdhr-\">react-native-calendars</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-v19-0-0-is-now-available-821a62b58d3d\">Released Expo SDK19</a> with a bunch of improvements across the board, and we&#x27;re now using the <a href=\"https://github.com/SoftwareMansion/jsc-android-buildscripts\">updated Android JSC</a>.</li><li>Working on a guide in docs with <a href=\"https://github.com/frantic\">Alexander Kotliarskyi</a> with a list of tips on how to improve the user experience of your app. Please join in and add to the list or help write some of it!<ul><li>Issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14979\">#14979</a></li><li>Initial pull request: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/14993\">#14993</a></li></ul></li><li>Continuing to work on: audio/video, camera, gestures (with Software Mansion, <code>react-native-gesture-handler</code>), GL camera integration and hoping to land some of these for the first time in SDK20 (August), and significant improvements to others by then as well. We&#x27;re just getting started on building infrastructure into the Expo client for background work (geolocation, audio, handling notifications, etc.).</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/skevy\">Adam Miskiewicz</a> has made some nice progress on imitating the transitions from <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller\">UINavigationController</a> in <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation\">react-navigation</a>. Check out an earlier version of it in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skevy/status/884932473070735361\">his tweet</a> - release coming with it soon. Also check out <code>MaskedViewIOS</code> which he <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8ea6cea39a3db6171dd74838a6eea4631cf42bba\">upstreamed</a>. If you have the skills and desire to implement <code>MaskedView</code> for Android that would be awesome!</li></ul><h3>Facebook</h3><ul><li>Facebook is internally exploring being able to embed native <a href=\"http://componentkit.org/\">ComponentKit</a> and <a href=\"https://fblitho.com/\">Litho</a> components inside of React Native.</li><li>Contributions to React Native are very welcome! If you are wondering how you can contribute, the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">\"How to Contribute\" guide</a> describes our development process and lays out the steps to send your first pull request. There are other ways to contribute that do not require writing code, such as by triaging issues or updating the docs.<ul><li>At the time of writing, React Native has <strong>635</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues\">open issues</a> and <strong>249</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls\">open pull requests</a>. This is overwhelming for our maintainers, and when things get fixed internally, it is difficult to ensure the relevant tasks are updated.</li><li>We are unsure what the best approach is to handle this while keeping the community satisfied. Some (but not all!) options include closing stale issues, giving significantly more people permissions to manage issues, and automatically closing issues that do not follow the issue template. We wrote a \"What to Expect from Maintainers\" guide to set expectations and avoid surprises. If you have ideas on how we can make this experience better for maintainers as well as ensuring people opening issues and pull requests feel heard and valued, please let us know!</li></ul></li></ul><h3>GeekyAnts</h3><ul><li>We demoed the Designer Tool which works with React Native files on Chain React. Many attendees signed up for the waiting list.</li><li>We are also looking at other cross-platform solutions like <a href=\"https://flutter.io/\">Google Flutter</a> (a major comparison coming along), <a href=\"https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native\">Kotlin Native</a>, and <a href=\"https://weex.incubator.apache.org/\">Apache Weex</a> to understand the architectural differences and what we can learn from them to improve the overall performance of React Native.</li><li>Switched to <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation\">react-navigation</a> for most of our apps, which has improved the overall performance.</li><li>Also, announced <a href=\"https://market.nativebase.io/\">NativeBase Market</a> - A marketplace for React Native components and apps (for and by the developers).</li></ul><h3>Infinite Red</h3><ul><li>We want to introduce the <a href=\"https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron\">Reactotron</a>. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPBRfxswDjA\">introductory video</a>. We&#x27;ll be adding more features very soon!</li><li>Organised Chain React Conference. It was awesome, thanks all for coming! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHvL21g9bk3RxJ1Ut5nR_uTZFVOxu522\">The videos are now online!</a></li></ul><h3>Microsoft</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push\">CodePush</a> has now been integrated into <a href=\"https://mobile.azure.com/\">Mobile Center</a>. Existing users will have no change in their workflow.<ul><li>Some people have reported an issue with duplicate apps - they already had an app on Mobile Center. We are working on resolving them, but if you have two apps, let us know, and we can merge them for you.</li></ul></li><li>Mobile Center now supports Push Notifications for CodePush. We also showed how a combination of Notifications and CodePush could be used for A/B testing apps - something unique to the ReactNative architecture.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode\">VSCode</a> has a known debugging issue with ReactNative - the next release of the extension in a couple of days will be fixing the issue.</li><li>Since there are many other teams also working on React Native inside Microsoft, we will work on getting better representation from all the groups for the next meeting.</li></ul><h3>Shoutem</h3><ul><li>Finished the process of making the React Native development easier on <a href=\"https://shoutem.github.io/\">Shoutem</a>. You can use all the standard <code>react-native</code> commands when developing apps on Shoutem.</li><li>We did a lot of work trying to figure out how to best approach the profiling on React Native. A big chunk of <a href=\"/docs/performance\">documentation</a> is outdated, and we&#x27;ll do our best to create a pull request on the official docs or at least write some of our conclusions in a blog post.</li><li>Switching our navigation solution to <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation\">react-navigation</a>, so we might have some feedback soon.</li><li>We released <a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem/ui/tree/develop/html\">a new HTML component</a> in our toolkit which transforms the raw HTML to the React Native components tree.</li></ul><h3>Wix</h3><ul><li>We started working on a pull request to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro\">Metro Bundler</a> with <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-repackager\">react-native-repackager</a> capabilities. We updated react-native-repackager to support RN 44 (which we use in production). We are using it for our mocking infrastructure for <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/detox\">detox</a>.</li><li>We have been covering the Wix app in detox tests for the last three weeks. It&#x27;s an amazing learning experience of how to reduce manual QA in an app of this scale (over 40 engineers). We have resolved several issues with detox as a result, a new version was just published. I am happy to report that we are living up to the \"zero flakiness policy\" and the tests are passing consistently so far.</li><li>Detox for Android is moving forward nicely. We are getting significant help from the community. We are expecting an initial version in about two weeks.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wix/detoxinstruments\">DetoxInstruments</a>, our performance testing tool, is getting a little bigger than we originally intended. We are now planning to turn it into a standalone tool that will not be tightly coupled to detox. It will allow investigating the performance of iOS apps in general. It will also be integrated with detox so we can run automated tests on performance metrics.</li></ul><h2>Next session</h2><p>The next session is scheduled for August 16, 2017. As this was only our second meeting, we&#x27;d like to know how do these notes benefit the React Native community. Feel free to ping me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomislavTenodi\">on Twitter</a> if you have any suggestion on how we should improve the output of the meeting.</p> "

That&#x27;s why we decided to organize a monthly meeting where all major React Native contributors can briefly present what their efforts and plans are.</p><h2>Monthly meetings</h2><p>We had our first session of the monthly meeting on June 14, 2017. The mission for React Native Monthly is simple and straightforward: <strong>improve the React Native community</strong>. Presenting teams&#x27; efforts eases collaboration between teams done offline.</p><h2>Teams</h2><p>On the first meeting, we had 8 teams join us:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb\">Airbnb</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/callstack-io\">Callstack</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/expo\">Expo</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/GeekyAnts\">GeekyAnts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft\">Microsoft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/shoutem\">Shoutem</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wix\">Wix</a></li></ul><p>We hope to have more core contributors join the upcoming sessions!</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>As teams&#x27; plans might be of interest to a broader audience, we&#x27;ll be sharing them here, on the React Native blog. So, here they are:</p><h3>Airbnb</h3><ul><li>Plans to add some A11y (accessibility) APIs to <code>View</code> and the <code>AccessibilityInfo</code> native module.</li><li>Will be investigating adding some APIs to native modules on Android to allow for specifying threads for them to run on.</li><li>Have been investigating potential initialization performance improvements.</li><li>Have been investigating some more sophisticated bundling strategies to use on top of \"unbundle\".</li></ul><h3>Callstack</h3><ul><li>Looking into improving the release process by using <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/detox\">Detox</a> for E2E testing. Pull request should land soon.</li><li>Blob pull request they have been working on has been merged, subsequent pull requests coming up.</li><li>Increasing <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack-io/haul\">Haul</a> adoption across internal projects to see how it performs compared to <a href=\"http://github.com/facebook/metro-bundler\">Metro Bundler</a>. Working on better multi-threaded performance with the Webpack team.</li><li>Internally, they have implemented a better infrastructure to manage open source projects. Plans to be getting more stuff out in upcoming weeks.</li><li>The React Native Europe conference is coming along, nothing interesting yet, but y&#x27;all invited!</li><li>Stepped back from <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation\">react-navigation</a> for a while to investigate alternatives (especially native navigations).</li></ul><h3>Expo</h3><ul><li>Working on making it possible to install npm modules in <a href=\"https://snack.expo.io/\">Snack</a>, will be useful for libraries to add examples to documentation.</li><li>Working with <a href=\"https://github.com/kmagiera\">Krzysztof</a> and other people at <a href=\"https://github.com/software-mansion\">Software Mansion</a> on a JSC update on Android and a gesture handling library.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/skevy\">Adam Miskiewicz</a> is transitioning his focus towards <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation\">react-navigation</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app\">Create React Native App</a> is in the <a href=\"/docs/getting-started\">Getting Started guide</a> in the docs. Expo wants to encourage library authors to explain clearly whether their lib works with CRNA or not, and if so, explain how to set it up.</li></ul><h3>Facebook</h3><ul><li>React Native&#x27;s packager is now <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro\">Metro Bundler</a>, in an independent repo. The Metro Bundler team in London is excited to address the needs of the community, improve modularity for additional use-cases beyond React Native, and increase responsiveness on issues and PRs.</li><li>In the coming months, the React Native team will work on refining the APIs of primitive components. Expect improvements in layout quirks, accessibility, and flow typing.</li><li>The React Native team also plans on improving core modularity this year, by refactoring to fully support 3rd party platforms such as Windows and macOS.</li></ul><h3>GeekyAnts</h3><ul><li>The team is working on a UI/UX design app (codename: Builder) which directly works with <code>.js</code> files. Right now, it supports only React Native. It\u2019s similar to Adobe XD and Sketch.</li><li>The team is working hard so that you can load up an existing React Native app in the editor, make changes (visually, as a designer) and save the changes directly to the JS file.</li><li>Folks are trying to bridge the gap between Designers and Developers and bring them on the same repo.</li><li>Also, <a href=\"https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase\">NativeBase</a> recently reached 5,000 GitHub stars.</li></ul><h3>Microsoft</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push\">CodePush</a> has now been integrated into <a href=\"https://mobile.azure.com/\">Mobile Center</a>. This is the first step in providing a much more integrated experience with distribution, analytics and other services. See their announcement <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/articles/CodePushOnMobileCenter.html\">here</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode\">VSCode</a> has a bug with debugging, they are working on fixing that right now and will have a new build.</li><li>Investigating <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/detox\">Detox</a> for Integration testing, looking at JSC Context to get variables alongside crash reports.</li></ul><h3>Shoutem</h3><ul><li>Making it easier to work on Shoutem apps with tools from the React Native community. You will be able to use all the React Native commands to run the apps created on <a href=\"https://shoutem.github.io/\">Shoutem</a>.</li><li>Investigating profiling tools for React Native. They had a lot of problems setting it up and they will write some of the insights they discovered along the way.</li><li>Shoutem is working on making it easier to integrate React Native with existing native apps. They will document the concept that they developed internally in the company, in order to get the feedback from the community.</li></ul><h3>Wix</h3><ul><li>Working internally to adopt <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/detox\">Detox</a> to move significant parts of the Wix app to \"zero manual QA\". As a result, Detox is being used heavily in a production setting by dozens of developers and maturing rapidly.</li><li>Working to add support to the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/metro\">Metro Bundler</a> for overriding any file extension during the build. Instead of just \"ios\" and \"android\", it would support any custom extension like \"e2e\" or \"detox\". Plans to use this for E2E mocking. There&#x27;s already a library out called <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-repackager\">react-native-repackager</a>, now working on a PR.</li><li>Investigating automation of performance tests. This is a new repo called <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/DetoxInstruments\">DetoxInstruments</a>. You can take a look, it&#x27;s being developed open source.</li><li>Working with a contributor from KPN on Detox for Android and supporting real devices.</li><li>Thinking about \"Detox as a platform\" to allow building other tools that need to automate the simulator/device. An example is <a href=\"https://github.com/storybooks/react-native-storybook\">Storybook</a> for React Native or Ram&#x27;s idea for integration testing.</li></ul><h2>Next session</h2><p>Meetings will be held every four weeks. The next session is scheduled for July 12, 2017. As we just started with this meeting, we&#x27;d like to know how do these notes benefit the React Native community. Feel free to ping me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomislavTenodi\">on Twitter</a> if you have any suggestion on what we should cover in the following sessions, or how we should improve the output of the meeting.</p> "

Provide an array of data and a <code>renderItem</code> function and you&#x27;re good to go:</p><pre><code><FlatList data={[{title: &#x27;Title Text&#x27;, key: &#x27;item1&#x27;}, ...]} renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item.title} />} /> </code></pre><h3><a href=\"/docs/sectionlist\"><code><SectionList></code></a></h3><p>If you want to render a set of data broken into logical sections, maybe with section headers (e.g. in an alphabetical address book), and potentially with heterogeneous data and rendering (such as a profile view with some buttons followed by a composer, then a photo grid, then a friend grid, and finally a list of stories), this is the way to go.</p><pre><code><SectionList renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item.title} />} renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <H1 title={section.key} />} sections={[ // homogeneous rendering between sections {data: [...], key: ...}, {data: [...], key: ...}, {data: [...], key: ...}, ]} /> <SectionList sections={[ // heterogeneous rendering between sections {data: [...], key: ..., renderItem: ...}, {data: [...], key: ..., renderItem: ...}, {data: [...], key: ..., renderItem: ...}, ]} /> </code></pre><h3><a href=\"/docs/virtualizedlist\"><code><VirtualizedList></code></a></h3><p>The implementation behind the scenes with a more flexible API. Especially handy if your data is not in a plain array (e.g. an immutable list).</p><h2>Features</h2><p>Lists are used in many contexts, so we packed the new components full of features to handle the majority of use cases out of the box:</p><ul><li>Scroll loading (<code>onEndReached</code>).</li><li>Pull to refresh (<code>onRefresh</code> / <code>refreshing</code>).</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/CustomComponents/Lists/ViewabilityHelper.js\">Configurable</a> viewability (VPV) callbacks (<code>onViewableItemsChanged</code> / <code>viewabilityConfig</code>).</li><li>Horizontal mode (<code>horizontal</code>).</li><li>Intelligent item and section separators.</li><li>Multi-column support (<code>numColumns</code>)</li><li><code>scrollToEnd</code>, <code>scrollToIndex</code>, and <code>scrollToItem</code></li><li>Better Flow typing.</li></ul><h3>Some Caveats</h3><ul><li><p>The internal state of item subtrees is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.</p></li><li><p>These components are based on <code>PureComponent</code> which means that they will not re-render if <code>props</code> remains shallow-equal. Make sure that everything your <code>renderItem</code> function depends on directly is passed as a prop that is not <code>===</code> after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the <code>data</code> prop and parent component state. For example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\"><FlatList data={this.state.data} renderItem={({ item }) => ( <MyItem item={item} onPress={() => this.setState((oldState) => ({ selected: { // New instance breaks `===` ...oldState.selected, // copy old data [item.key]: !oldState.selected[item.key] // toggle } })) } selected={ !!this.state.selected[item.key] // renderItem depends on state } /> )} selected={ // Can be any prop that doesn&#x27;t collide with existing props this.state.selected // A change to selected should re-render FlatList } /> </code></pre></li><li><p>In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously offscreen. This means it&#x27;s possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application, and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.</p></li><li><p>By default, these new lists look for a <code>key</code> prop on each item and use that for the React key. Alternatively, you can provide a custom <code>keyExtractor</code> prop.</p></li></ul><h2>Performance</h2><p>Besides simplifying the API, the new list components also have significant performance enhancements, the main one being nearly constant memory usage for any number of rows. This is done by &#x27;virtualizing&#x27; elements that are outside of the render window by completely unmounting them from the component hierarchy and reclaiming the JS memory from the react components, along with the native memory from the shadow tree and the UI views. This has a catch which is that internal component state will not be preserved, so <strong>make sure you track any important state outside of the components themselves, e.g. in Relay or Redux or Flux store.</strong></p><p>Limiting the render window also reduces the amount of work that needs to be done by React and the native platform, e.g from view traversals. Even if you are rendering the last of a million elements, with these new lists there is no need to iterate through all those elements in order to render. You can even jump to the middle with <code>scrollToIndex</code> without excessive rendering.</p><p>We&#x27;ve also made some improvements with scheduling which should help with application responsiveness. Items at the edge of the render window are rendered infrequently and at a lower priority after any active gestures or animations or other interactions have completed.</p><h2>Advanced Usage</h2><p>Unlike <code>ListView</code>, all items in the render window are re-rendered any time any props change. Often this is fine because the windowing reduces the number of items to a constant number, but if your items are on the complex side, you should make sure to follow React best practices for performance and use <code>React.PureComponent</code> and/or <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> as appropriate within your components to limit re-renders of the recursive subtree.</p><p>If you can calculate the height of your rows without rendering them, you can improve the user experience by providing the <code>getItemLayout</code> prop. This makes it much smoother to scroll to specific items with e.g. <code>scrollToIndex</code>, and will improve the scroll indicator UI because the height of the content can be determined without rendering it.</p><p>If you have an alternative data type, like an immutable list, <code><VirtualizedList></code> is the way to go. It takes a <code>getItem</code> prop that lets you return the item data for any given index and has looser flow typing.</p><p>There are also a bunch of parameters you can tweak if you have an unusual use case. For example, you can use <code>windowSize</code> to trade off memory usage vs. user experience, <code>maxToRenderPerBatch</code> to adjust fill rate vs. responsiveness, <code>onEndReachedThreshold</code> to control when scroll loading happens, and more.</p><h2>Future Work</h2><ul><li>Migration of existing surfaces (ultimately deprecation of <code>ListView</code>).</li><li>More features as we see/hear the need (let us know!).</li><li>Sticky section header support.</li><li>More performance optimizations.</li><li>Support functional item components with state.</li></ul> "

On the way to accessing these deeply nested values, it is common for one or more intermediate fields to be nullable. These intermediate fields may be null for a variety of reasons, from failed privacy checks to the mere fact that null happens to be the most flexible way to represent non-fatal errors.</p><p>Unfortunately, accessing these deeply nested values is currently tedious and verbose.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">props.user && props.user.friends && props.user.friends[0] && props.user.friends[0].friends; </code></pre><p>There is <a href=\"https://github.com/claudepache/es-optional-chaining\">an ECMAScript proposal to introduce the existential operator</a> which will make this much more convenient. But until a time when that proposal is finalized, we want a solution that improves our quality of life, maintains existing language semantics, and encourages type safety with Flow.</p><p>We came up with an existential <em>function</em> we call <code>idx</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">idx(props, (_) => _.user.friends[0].friends); </code></pre><p>The invocation in this code snippet behaves similarly to the boolean expression in the code snippet above, except with significantly less repetition. The <code>idx</code> function takes exactly two arguments:</p><ul><li>Any value, typically an object or array into which you want to access a nested value.</li><li>A function that receives the first argument and accesses a nested value on it.</li></ul><p>In theory, the <code>idx</code> function will try-catch errors that are the result of accessing properties on null or undefined. If such an error is caught, it will return either null or undefined. (And you can see how this might be implemented in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/idx/blob/master/packages/idx/src/idx.js\">idx.js</a>.)</p><p>In practice, try-catching every nested property access is slow, and differentiating between specific kinds of TypeErrors is fragile. To deal with these shortcomings, we created a Babel plugin that transforms the above <code>idx</code> invocation into the following expression:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">props.user == null ? props.user : props.user.friends == null ? props.user.friends : props.user.friends[0] == null ? props.user.friends[0] : props.user.friends[0].friends; </code></pre><p>Finally, we added a custom Flow type declaration for <code>idx</code> that allows the traversal in the second argument to be properly type-checked while permitting nested access on nullable properties.</p><p>The function, Babel plugin, and Flow declaration are now <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/idx\">available on GitHub</a>. They are used by installing the <strong>idx</strong> and <strong>babel-plugin-idx</strong> npm packages, and adding \u201Cidx\u201D to the list of plugins in your <code>.babelrc</code> file.</p> "

It\u2019s heavily inspired by the design of <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\">Create React App</a> and is the product of a collaboration between <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://expo.io\">Expo</a> (formerly Exponent).</p><p>Many developers struggle with installing and configuring React Native\u2019s current native build dependencies, especially for Android. With Create React Native App, there\u2019s no need to use Xcode or Android Studio, and you can develop for your iOS device using Linux or Windows. This is accomplished using the Expo app, which loads and runs CRNA projects written in pure JavaScript without compiling any native code.</p><p>Try creating a new project (replace with suitable yarn commands if you have it installed):</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ npm i -g create-react-native-app $ create-react-native-app my-project $ cd my-project $ npm start </code></pre><p>This will start the React Native packager and print a QR code. Open it in the <a href=\"https://expo.io\">Expo app</a> to load your JavaScript. Calls to <code>console.log</code> are forwarded to your terminal. You can make use of any standard React Native APIs as well as the <a href=\"https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/index.html\">Expo SDK</a>.</p><h2>What about native code?</h2><p>Many React Native projects have Java or Objective-C/Swift dependencies that need to be compiled. The Expo app does include APIs for camera, video, contacts, and more, and bundles popular libraries like <a href=\"https://docs.expo.io/versions/v14.0.0/sdk/map-view.html\">Airbnb\u2019s react-native-maps</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/facebook.html\">Facebook authentication</a>. However if you need a native code dependency that Expo doesn\u2019t bundle then you\u2019ll probably need to have your own build configuration for it. Just like Create React App, \u201Cejecting\u201D is supported by CRNA.</p><p>You can run <code>npm run eject</code> to get a project very similar to what <code>react-native init</code> would generate. At that point you\u2019ll need Xcode and/or Android Studio just as you would if you started with <code>react-native init</code> , adding libraries with <code>react-native link</code> will work, and you\u2019ll have full control over the native code compilation process.</p><h2>Questions? Feedback?</h2><p>Create React Native App is now stable enough for general use, which means we\u2019re very eager to hear about your experience using it! You can find me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dika10sune\">on Twitter</a> or open an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app\">the GitHub repository</a>. Pull requests are very welcome!</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>For the past year, we&#x27;ve been working on improving performance of animations that use the Animated library. Animations are very important to create a beautiful user experience but can also be hard to do right. We want to make it easy for developers to create performant animations without having to worry about some of their code causing it to lag.</p><h2>What is this?</h2><p>The Animated API was designed with a very important constraint in mind, it is serializable. This means we can send everything about the animation to native before it has even started and allows native code to perform the animation on the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame. It is very useful because once the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked and the animation will still run smoothly. In practice this can happen a lot because user code runs on the JS thread and React renders can also lock JS for a long time.</p><h2>A bit of history...</h2><p>This project started about a year ago, when Expo built the li.st app on Android. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kzzzf\">Krzysztof Magiera</a> was contracted to build the initial implementation on Android. It ended up working well and li.st was the first app to ship with native driven animations using Animated. A few months later, <a href=\"https://github.com/buba447\">Brandon Withrow</a> built the initial implementation on iOS. After that, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryangomba\">Ryan Gomba</a> and myself worked on adding missing features like support for <code>Animated.event</code> as well as squash bugs we found when using it in production apps. This was truly a community effort and I would like to thanks everyone that was involved as well as Expo for sponsoring a large part of the development. It is now used by <code>Touchable</code> components in React Native as well as for navigation animations in the newly released <a href=\"https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation\">React Navigation</a> library.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>First, let&#x27;s check out how animations currently work using Animated with the JS driver. When using Animated, you declare a graph of nodes that represent the animations that you want to perform, and then use a driver to update an Animated value using a predefined curve. You may also update an Animated value by connecting it to an event of a <code>View</code> using <code>Animated.event</code>.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/animated-diagram.png\"/></p><p>Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the steps for an animation and where it happens:</p><ul><li>JS: The animation driver uses <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> to execute on every frame and update the value it drives using the new value it calculates based on the animation curve.</li><li>JS: Intermediate values are calculated and passed to a props node that is attached to a <code>View</code>.</li><li>JS: The <code>View</code> is updated using <code>setNativeProps</code>.</li><li>JS to Native bridge.</li><li>Native: The <code>UIView</code> or <code>android.View</code> is updated.</li></ul><p>As you can see, most of the work happens on the JS thread. If it is blocked the animation will skip frames. It also needs to go through the JS to Native bridge on every frame to update native views.</p><p>What the native driver does is move all of these steps to native. Since Animated produces a graph of animated nodes, it can be serialized and sent to native only once when the animation starts, eliminating the need to callback into the JS thread; the native code can take care of updating the views directly on the UI thread on every frame.</p><p>Here&#x27;s an example of how we can serialize an animated value and an interpolation node (not the exact implementation, just an example).</p><p>Create the native value node, this is the value that will be animated:</p><pre><code>NativeAnimatedModule.createNode({ id: 1, type: &#x27;value&#x27;, initialValue: 0, }); </code></pre><p>Create the native interpolation node, this tells the native driver how to interpolate a value:</p><pre><code>NativeAnimatedModule.createNode({ id: 2, type: &#x27;interpolation&#x27;, inputRange: [0, 10], outputRange: [10, 0], extrapolate: &#x27;clamp&#x27;, }); </code></pre><p>Create the native props node, this tells the native driver which prop on the view it is attached to:</p><pre><code>NativeAnimatedModule.createNode({ id: 3, type: &#x27;props&#x27;, properties: [&#x27;style.opacity&#x27;], }); </code></pre><p>Connect nodes together:</p><pre><code>NativeAnimatedModule.connectNodes(1, 2); NativeAnimatedModule.connectNodes(2, 3); </code></pre><p>Connect the props node to a view:</p><pre><code>NativeAnimatedModule.connectToView(3, ReactNative.findNodeHandle(viewRef)); </code></pre><p>With that, the native animated module has all the info it needs to update the native views directly without having to go to JS to calculate any value.</p><p>All there is left to do is actually start the animation by specifying what type of animation curve we want and what animated value to update. Timing animations can also be simplified by calculating every frame of the animation in advance in JS to make the native implementation smaller.</p><pre><code>NativeAnimatedModule.startAnimation({ type: &#x27;timing&#x27;, frames: [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.65, ...], animatedValueId: 1, }); </code></pre><p>And now here&#x27;s the breakdown of what happens when the animation runs:</p><ul><li>Native: The native animation driver uses <code>CADisplayLink</code> or <code>android.view.Choreographer</code> to execute on every frame and update the value it drives using the new value it calculates based on the animation curve.</li><li>Native: Intermediate values are calculated and passed to a props node that is attached to a native view.</li><li>Native: The <code>UIView</code> or <code>android.View</code> is updated.</li></ul><p>As you can see, no more JS thread and no more bridge which means faster animations! ðð</p><h2>How do I use this in my app?</h2><p>For normal animations the answer is simple, just add <code>useNativeDriver: true</code> to the animation config when starting it.</p><p>Before:</p><pre><code>Animated.timing(this.state.animatedValue, { toValue: 1, duration: 500, }).start(); </code></pre><p>After:</p><pre><code>Animated.timing(this.state.animatedValue, { toValue: 1, duration: 500, useNativeDriver: true, // <-- Add this }).start(); </code></pre><p>Animated values are only compatible with one driver so if you use native driver when starting an animation on a value, make sure every animation on that value also uses the native driver.</p><p>It also works with <code>Animated.event</code>, this is very useful if you have an animation that must follow the scroll position because without the native driver it will always run a frame behind of the gesture because of the async nature of React Native.</p><p>Before:</p><pre><code><ScrollView scrollEventThrottle={16} onScroll={Animated.event( [{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { y: this.state.animatedValue } } }] )} > {content} </ScrollView> </code></pre><p>After:</p><pre><code><Animated.ScrollView // <-- Use the Animated ScrollView wrapper scrollEventThrottle={1} // <-- Use 1 here to make sure no events are ever missed onScroll={Animated.event( [{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { y: this.state.animatedValue } } }], { useNativeDriver: true } // <-- Add this )} > {content} </Animated.ScrollView> </code></pre><h2>Caveats</h2><p>Not everything you can do with Animated is currently supported in Native Animated. The main limitation is that you can only animate non-layout properties, things like <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code> will work but Flexbox and position properties won&#x27;t. Another one is with <code>Animated.event</code>, it will only work with direct events and not bubbling events. This means it does not work with <code>PanResponder</code> but does work with things like <code>ScrollView#onScroll</code>.</p><p>Native Animated has also been part of React Native for quite a while but has never been documented because it was considered experimental. Because of that make sure you are using a recent version (0.40+) of React Native if you want to use this feature.</p><h2>Resources</h2><p>For more information about animated I recommend watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtqUJVqpKNo\">this talk</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vjeux\">Christopher Chedeau</a>.</p><p>If you want a deep dive into animations and how offloading them to native can improve user experience there is also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgSMjYWqBk4\">this talk</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kzzzf\">Krzysztof Magiera</a>.</p> "

By not overwriting we don&#x27;t get the latest updates.</p><p>Today I am proud to introduce a new tool that helps solve this problem. The tool is called <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> and uses Git behind the scenes to resolve conflicts automatically whenever possible.</p><h2>Usage</h2><blockquote><p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Git has to be available in the <code>PATH</code>. Your project doesn&#x27;t have to be managed by Git.</p></blockquote><p>Install <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> globally:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ npm install -g react-native-git-upgrade </code></pre><p>or, using <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">Yarn</a>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ yarn global add react-native-git-upgrade </code></pre><p>Then, run it inside your project directory:</p><pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ cd MyProject $ react-native-git-upgrade 0.38.0 </code></pre><blockquote><p>Note: Do <strong>not</strong> run &#x27;npm install&#x27; to install a new version of <code>react-native</code>. The tool needs to be able to compare the old and new project template to work correctly. Simply run it inside your app folder as shown above, while still on the old version.</p></blockquote><p>Example output:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/git-upgrade-output.png\"/></p><p>You can also run <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> with no arguments to upgrade to the latest version of React Native.</p><p>We try to preserve your changes in Android and iOS build files, so you don&#x27;t need to run <code>react-native link</code> after an upgrade.</p><p>We have designed the implementation to be as little intrusive as possible. It is entirely based on a local Git repository created on-the-fly in a temporary directory. It won&#x27;t interfere with your project repository (no matter what VCS you use: Git, SVN, Mercurial, ... or none). Your sources are restored in case of unexpected errors.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>The key step is generating a Git patch. The patch contains all the changes made in the React Native templates between the version your app is using and the new version.</p><p>To obtain this patch, we need to generate an app from the templates embedded in the <code>react-native</code> package inside your <code>node_modules</code> directory (these are the same templates the <code>react-native init</code> commands uses). Then, after the native apps have been generated from the templates in both the current version and the new version, Git is able to produce a patch that is adapted to your project (i.e. containing your app name):</p><pre><code>[...] diff --git a/ios/MyAwesomeApp/Info.plist b/ios/MyAwesomeApp/Info.plist index e98ebb0..2fb6a11 100644 --- a/ios/MyAwesomeApp/Info.plist +++ b/ios/MyAwesomeApp/Info.plist @@ -45,7 +45,7 @@ <dict> <key>localhost</key> <dict> - <key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key> + <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key> <true/> </dict> </dict> [...] </code></pre><p>All we need now is to apply this patch to your source files. While the old <code>react-native upgrade</code> process would have prompted you for any small difference, Git is able to merge most of the changes automatically using its 3-way merge algorithm and eventually leave us with familiar conflict delimiters:</p><pre><code> 13B07F951A680F5B00A75B9A /* Release */ = { isa = XCBuildConfiguration; buildSettings = { ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon; <<<<<<< ours CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = \"iPhone Developer\"; FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = ( \"$(inherited)\", \"$(PROJECT_DIR)/HockeySDK.embeddedframework\", \"$(PROJECT_DIR)/HockeySDK-iOS/HockeySDK.embeddedframework\", ); ======= CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1; >>>>>>> theirs HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = ( \"$(inherited)\", /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include, \"$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/React/**\", \"$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-code-push/ios/CodePush/**\", ); </code></pre><p>These conflicts are generally easy to reason about. The delimiter <strong>ours</strong> stands for \"your team\" whereas <strong>theirs</strong> could be seen as \"the React Native team\".</p><h2>Why introduce a new global package?</h2><p>React Native comes with a global CLI (the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli\">react-native-cli</a> package) which delegates commands to the local CLI embedded in the <code>node_modules/react-native/local-cli</code> directory.</p><p>As we mentioned above, the process has to be started from your current React Native version. If we had embedded the implementation in the local-cli, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to enjoy this feature when using old versions of React Native. For example, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to upgrade from 0.29.2 to 0.38.0 if this new upgrade code was only released in 0.38.0.</p><p>Upgrading based on Git is a big improvement in developer experience and it is important to make it available to everyone. By using a separate package <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-git-upgrade\">react-native-git-upgrade</a> installed globally you can use this new code today no matter what version of React Native your project is using.</p><p>One more reason is the recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinkonicek/status/800730190141857793\">Yeoman wipeout</a> by Martin Konicek. We didn&#x27;t want to get these Yeoman dependencies back into the <code>react-native</code> package to be able to evaluate the old template in order to create the patch.</p><h2>Try it out and provide feedback</h2><p>As a conclusion, I would say, enjoy the feature and feel free <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues\">to suggest improvements, report issues</a> and especially <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls\">send pull requests</a>. Each environment is a bit different and each React Native project is different, and we need your feedback to make this work well for everyone.</p><h3>Thank you!</h3><p>I would like to thank the awesome companies <a href=\"http://www.zenika.com\">Zenika</a> and <a href=\"http://www.groupem6.fr/le-groupe_en/activites/diversifications/m6-web.html\">M6 Web</a> without whom none of this would have been possible!</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>We have heard from many people that there is so much work happening with React Native, it can be tough to keep track of what&#x27;s going on. To help communicate what work is in progress, we are now publishing a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Roadmap\">roadmap for React Native</a>. At a high level, this work can be broken down into three priorities:</p><ul><li><strong>Core Libraries</strong>. Adding more functionality to the most useful components and APIs.</li><li><strong>Stability</strong>. Improve the underlying infrastructure to reduce bugs and improve code quality.</li><li><strong>Developer Experience</strong>. Help React Native developers move faster</li></ul><p>If you have suggestions for features that you think would be valuable on the roadmap, check out <a href=\"https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests\">Canny</a>, where you can suggest new features and discuss existing proposals.</p><h2>What&#x27;s new in React Native</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.37.0\">Version 0.37 of React Native</a>, released today, introduces a new core component to make it really easy to add a touchable Button to any app. We&#x27;re also introducing support for the new <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">Yarn</a> package manager, which should speed up the whole process of updating your app&#x27;s dependencies.</p><h2>Introducing Button</h2><p>Today we&#x27;re introducing a basic <code><Button /></code> component that looks great on every platform. This addresses one of the most common pieces of feedback we get: React Native is one of the only mobile development toolkits without a button ready to use out of the box.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/button-android-ios.png\" alt=\"Simple Button on Android, iOS\"/></p><pre><code><Button onPress={onPressMe} title=\"Press Me\" accessibilityLabel=\"Learn more about this Simple Button\" /> </code></pre><p>Experienced React Native developers know how to make a button: use TouchableOpacity for the default look on iOS, TouchableNativeFeedback for the ripple effect on Android, then apply a few styles. Custom buttons aren&#x27;t particularly hard to build or install, but we aim to make React Native radically easy to learn. With the addition of a basic button into core, newcomers will be able to develop something awesome in their first day, rather than spending that time formatting a Button and learning about Touchable nuances.</p><p>Button is meant to work great and look native on every platform, so it won&#x27;t support all the bells and whistles that custom buttons do. It is a great starting point, but is not meant to replace all your existing buttons. To learn more, check out the <a href=\"/docs/button\">new Button documentation</a>, complete with a runnable example!</p><h2>Speed up <code>react-native init</code> using Yarn</h2><p>You can now use <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">Yarn</a>, the new package manager for JavaScript, to speed up <code>react-native init</code> significantly. To see the speedup please <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install\">install yarn</a> and upgrade your <code>react-native-cli</code> to 1.2.0:</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ npm install -g react-native-cli </code></pre><p>You should now see \u201CUsing yarn\u201D when setting up new apps:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/yarn-rncli.png\" alt=\"Using yarn\"/></p><p>In simple local testing <code>react-native init</code> finished in <strong>about 1 minute on a good network</strong> (vs around 3 minutes when using npm 3.10.8). Installing yarn is optional but highly recommended.</p><h2>Thank you!</h2><p>We&#x27;d like to thank everyone who contributed to this release. The full <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.37.0\">release notes</a> are now available on GitHub. With over two dozen bug fixes and new features, React Native just keeps getting better thanks to you.</p> "

            "#cdata-section": " <p>Today we are releasing <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.36.0\">React Native 0.36</a>. Read on to learn more about what&#x27;s new.</p><h2>Headless JS</h2><p>Headless JS is a way to run tasks in JavaScript while your app is in the background. It can be used, for example, to sync fresh data, handle push notifications, or play music. It is only available on Android, for now.</p><p>To get started, define your async task in a dedicated file (e.g. <code>SomeTaskName.js</code>):</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">module.exports = async (taskData) => { // Perform your task here. }; </code></pre><p>Next, register your task in on <code>AppRegistry</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">AppRegistry.registerHeadlessTask(&#x27;SomeTaskName&#x27;, () => require(&#x27;SomeTaskName&#x27;) ); </code></pre><p>Using Headless JS does require some native Java code to be written in order to allow you to start up the service when needed. Take a look at our new <a href=\"/docs/headless-js-android\">Headless JS docs</a> to learn more!</p><h2>The Keyboard API</h2><p>Working with the on-screen keyboard is now easier with <a href=\"/docs/keyboard\"><code>Keyboard</code></a>. You can now listen for native keyboard events and react to them. For example, to dismiss the active keyboard, simply call <code>Keyboard.dismiss()</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">import { Keyboard } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; // Hide that keyboard! Keyboard.dismiss(); </code></pre><h2>Animated Division</h2><p>Combining two animated values via addition, multiplication, and modulo are already supported by React Native. With version 0.36, combining two <a href=\"/docs/animated#divide\">animated values via division</a> is now possible. There are some cases where an animated value needs to invert another animated value for calculation. An example is inverting a scale (2x --> 0.5x):</p><pre><code>const a = Animated.Value(1); const b = Animated.divide(1, a); Animated.spring(a, { toValue: 2, }).start(); </code></pre><p><code>b</code> will then follow <code>a</code>&#x27;s spring animation and produce the value of <code>1 / a</code>.</p><p>The basic usage is like this:</p><pre><code><Animated.View style={{transform: [{scale: a}]}}> <Animated.Image style={{transform: [{scale: b}]}} /> <Animated.View> </code></pre><p>In this example, the inner image won&#x27;t get stretched at all because the parent&#x27;s scaling gets cancelled out. If you&#x27;d like to learn more, check out the <a href=\"/docs/animations\">Animations guide</a>.</p><h2>Dark Status Bars</h2><p>A new <code>barStyle</code> value has been added to <code>StatusBar</code>: <code>dark-content</code>. With this addition, you can now use <a href=\"/docs/statusbar#barstyle\"><code>barStyle</code></a> on both Android and iOS. The behavior will now be the following:</p><ul><li><code>default</code>: Use the platform default (light on iOS, dark on Android).</li><li><code>light-content</code>: Use a light status bar with black text and icons.</li><li><code>dark-content</code>: Use a dark status bar with white text and icons.</li></ul><h2>...and more</h2><p>The above is just a sample of what has changed in 0.36. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.36.0\">release notes on GitHub</a> to see the full list of new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes.</p><p>You can upgrade to 0.36 by running the following commands in a terminal:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ npm install --save react-native@0.36 $ react-native upgrade </code></pre> "

Over 20 countries and numerous people around the world use Right-to-Left (RTL) languages. Thus, making your app support RTL for them is necessary.</p><p>We&#x27;re glad to announce that React Native has been improved to support RTL layouts. This is now available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native\">react-native</a> master branch today, and will be available in the next RC: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases\"><code>v0.33.0-rc</code></a>.</p><p>This involved changing <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/css-layout\">css-layout</a>, the core layout engine used by RN, and RN core implementation, as well as specific OSS JS components to support RTL.</p><p>To battle test the RTL support in production, the latest version of the <strong>Facebook Ads Manager</strong> app (the first cross-platform 100% RN app) is now available in Arabic and Hebrew with RTL layouts for both <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id964397083\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.adsmanager\">Android</a>. Here is how it looks like in those RTL languages:</p><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-ama-ios-arabic.png\" width=\"280\" style=\"margin:10px\"/><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-ama-android-hebrew.png\" width=\"280\" style=\"margin:10px\"/><h2>Overview Changes in RN for RTL support</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/css-layout\">css-layout</a> already has a concept of <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> for the layout. In the Left-to-Right (LTR) layout, <code>start</code> means <code>left</code>, and <code>end</code> means <code>right</code>. But in RTL, <code>start</code> means <code>right</code>, and <code>end</code> means <code>left</code>. This means we can make RN depend on the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> calculation to compute the correct layout, which includes <code>position</code>, <code>padding</code>, and <code>margin</code>.</p><p>In addition, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/css-layout\">css-layout</a> already makes each component&#x27;s direction inherits from its parent. This means, we simply need to set the direction of the root component to RTL, and the entire app will flip.</p><p>The diagram below describes the changes at high level:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-rn-core-updates.png\"/></p><p>These include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/css-layout/commit/46c842c71a1232c3c78c4215275d104a389a9a0f\">css-layout RTL support for absolute positioning</a></li><li>mapping <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> to <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> in RN core implementation for shadow nodes</li><li>and exposing a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js\">bridged utility module</a> to help control the RTL layout</li></ul><p>With this update, when you allow RTL layout for your app:</p><ul><li>every component layout will flip horizontally</li><li>some gestures and animations will automatically have RTL layout, if you are using RTL-ready OSS components</li><li>minimal additional effort may be needed to make your app fully RTL-ready</li></ul><h2>Making an App RTL-ready</h2><ol><li><p>To support RTL, you should first add the RTL language bundles to your app.</p><ul><li>See the general guides from <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LocalizingYourApp/LocalizingYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000171i-CH5-SW1\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages.html\">Android</a>.</li></ul></li><li><p>Allow RTL layout for your app by calling the <code>allowRTL()</code> function at the beginning of native code. We provided this utility to only apply to an RTL layout when your app is ready. Here is an example:</p><p>iOS:</p><pre><code class=\"language-objc\">// in AppDelegate.m [[RCTI18nUtil sharedInstance] allowRTL:YES]; </code></pre><p>Android:</p><pre><code class=\"language-java\">// in MainActivity.java I18nUtil sharedI18nUtilInstance = I18nUtil.getInstance(); sharedI18nUtilInstance.allowRTL(context, true); </code></pre></li><li><p>For Android, you need add <code>android:supportsRtl=\"true\"</code> to the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html\"><code><application></code></a> element in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file.</p></li></ol><p>Now, when you recompile your app and change the device language to an RTL language (e.g. Arabic or Hebrew), your app layout should change to RTL automatically.</p><h2>Writing RTL-ready Components</h2><p>In general, most components are already RTL-ready, for example:</p><ul><li>Left-to-Right Layout</li></ul><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-demo-listitem-ltr.png\" width=\"300\"/><ul><li>Right-to-Left Layout</li></ul><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-demo-listitem-rtl.png\" width=\"300\"/><p>However, there are several cases to be aware of, for which you will need the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js\"><code>I18nManager</code></a>. In <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js\"><code>I18nManager</code></a>, there is a constant <code>isRTL</code> to tell if layout of app is RTL or not, so that you can make the necessary changes according to the layout.</p><h4>Icons with Directional Meaning</h4><p>If your component has icons or images, they will be displayed the same way in LTR and RTL layout, because RN will not flip your source image. Therefore, you should flip them according to the layout style.</p><ul><li>Left-to-Right Layout</li></ul><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-demo-icon-ltr.png\" width=\"300\"/><ul><li>Right-to-Left Layout</li></ul><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-demo-icon-rtl.png\" width=\"300\"/><p>Here are two ways to flip the icon according to the direction:</p><ul><li><p>Adding a <code>transform</code> style to the image component:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\"><Image source={...} style={{transform: [{scaleX: I18nManager.isRTL ? -1 : 1}]}} /> </code></pre></li><li><p>Or, changing the image source according to the direction:</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">let imageSource = require(&#x27;./back.png&#x27;); if (I18nManager.isRTL) { imageSource = require(&#x27;./forward.png&#x27;); } return <Image source={imageSource} />; </code></pre></li></ul><h4>Gestures and Animations</h4><p>In Android and iOS development, when you change to RTL layout, the gestures and animations are the opposite of LTR layout. Currently, in RN, gestures and animations are not supported on RN core code level, but on components level. The good news is, some of these components already support RTL today, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/38a6eec0db85a5204e85a9a92b4dee2db9641671/Libraries/Experimental/SwipeableRow/SwipeableRow.js\"><code>SwipeableRow</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Libraries/NavigationExperimental\"><code>NavigationExperimental</code></a>. However, other components with gestures will need to support RTL manually.</p><p>A good example to illustrate gesture RTL support is <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/38a6eec0db85a5204e85a9a92b4dee2db9641671/Libraries/Experimental/SwipeableRow/SwipeableRow.js\"><code>SwipeableRow</code></a>.</p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-demo-swipe-ltr.png\" width=\"280\" style=\"margin:10px\"/><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-demo-swipe-rtl.png\" width=\"280\" style=\"margin:10px\"/></p><h5>Gestures Example</h5><pre><code class=\"language-js\">// SwipeableRow.js _isSwipingExcessivelyRightFromClosedPosition(gestureState: Object): boolean { // ... const gestureStateDx = IS_RTL ? -gestureState.dx : gestureState.dx; return ( this._isSwipingRightFromClosed(gestureState) && gestureStateDx > RIGHT_SWIPE_THRESHOLD ); }, </code></pre><h5>Animation Example</h5><pre><code class=\"language-js\">// SwipeableRow.js _animateBounceBack(duration: number): void { // ... const swipeBounceBackDistance = IS_RTL ? -RIGHT_SWIPE_BOUNCE_BACK_DISTANCE : RIGHT_SWIPE_BOUNCE_BACK_DISTANCE; this._animateTo( -swipeBounceBackDistance, duration, this._animateToClosedPositionDuringBounce, ); }, </code></pre><h2>Maintaining Your RTL-ready App</h2><p>Even after the initial RTL-compatible app release, you will likely need to iterate on new features. To improve development efficiency, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f0fb228ec76ed49e6ed6d786d888e8113b8959a2/Libraries/Utilities/I18nManager.js\"><code>I18nManager</code></a> provides the <code>forceRTL()</code> function for faster RTL testing without changing the test device language. You might want to provide a simple switch for this in your app. Here&#x27;s an example from the RTL example in the RNTester:</p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/blog/assets/rtl-demo-forcertl.png\" width=\"300\"/></p><pre><code class=\"language-js\"><RNTesterBlock title={&#x27;Quickly Test RTL Layout&#x27;}> <View style={styles.flexDirectionRow}> <Text style={styles.switchRowTextView}>forceRTL</Text> <View style={styles.switchRowSwitchView}> <Switch onValueChange={this._onDirectionChange} style={styles.rightAlignStyle} value={this.state.isRTL} /> </View> </View> </RNTesterBlock>; _onDirectionChange = () => { I18nManager.forceRTL(!this.state.isRTL); this.setState({ isRTL: !this.state.isRTL }); Alert.alert( &#x27;Reload this page&#x27;, &#x27;Please reload this page to change the UI direction! &#x27; + &#x27;All examples in this app will be affected. &#x27; + &#x27;Check them out to see what they look like in RTL layout.&#x27; ); }; </code></pre><p>When working on a new feature, you can easily toggle this button and reload the app to see RTL layout. The benefit is you won&#x27;t need to change the language setting to test, however some text alignment won&#x27;t change, as explained in the next section. Therefore, it&#x27;s always a good idea to test your app in the RTL language before launching.</p><h2>Limitations and Future Plan</h2><p>The RTL support should cover most of the UX in your app; however, there are some limitations for now:</p><ul><li>Text alignment behaviors differ in Android and iOS<ul><li>In iOS, the default text alignment depends on the active language bundle, they are consistently on one side. In Android, the default text alignment depends on the language of the text content, i.e. English will be left-aligned and Arabic will be right-aligned.</li><li>In theory, this should be made consistent across platform, but some people may prefer one behavior to another when using an app. More user experience research may be needed to find out the best practice for text alignment.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>There is no \"true\" left/right</p><p>As discussed before, we map the <code>left</code>/<code>right</code> styles from the JS side to <code>start</code>/<code>end</code>, all <code>left</code> in code for RTL layout becomes \"right\" on screen, and <code>right</code> in code becomes \"left\" on screen. This is convenient because you don&#x27;t need to change your product code too much, but it means there is no way to specify \"true left\" or \"true right\" in the code. In the future, allowing a component to control its direction regardless of the language may be necessary.</p></li><li><p>Make RTL support for gestures and animations more developer friendly</p><p>Currently, there is still some programming effort required to make gestures and animations RTL compatible. In the future, it would be ideal to find a way to make gestures and animations RTL support more developer friendly.</p></li></ul><h2>Try it Out!</h2><p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/RTL/RTLExample.js\"><code>RTLExample</code></a> in the <code>RNTester</code> to understand more about RTL support, and let us know how it works for you!</p><p>Finally, thank you for reading! We hope that the RTL support for React Native helps you grow your apps for international audience!</p> "

With around 200 people in attendance, it served as a great place to meet other developers near me that are also interested in React Native.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/rnmsf-august-2016-hero.jpg\"/></p><p>I was particularly interested in learning more about how React and React Native are used at companies like Zynga, Netflix, and Airbnb. The agenda for the night would be as follows:</p><ul><li>Rapid Prototyping in React</li><li>Designing APIs for React Native</li><li>Bridging the Gap: Using React Native in Existing Codebases</li></ul><p>But first, the event started off with a quick introduction and a brief recap of recent news:</p><ul><li>Did you know that React Native is now the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamespearce/status/759637111880359937\">top Java repository on GitHub</a>?</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm\">rnpm</a> is now part of React Native core!

There are now over 4,800 developers across a variety of React Native meetup groups all over the globe.</li></ul><p>If <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=false&keywords=react+native&radius=Infinity&userFreeform=San+Francisco%2C+CA&mcId=z94105&mcName=San+Francisco%2C+CA&sort=recommended&eventFilter=mysugg\">one of these meetups</a> is held near you, I highly recommend attending!</p><h2>Rapid Prototyping in React at Zynga</h2><p>The first round of news was followed by a quick introduction by Zynga, our hosts for the evening. Abhishek Chadha talked about how they use React to quickly prototype new experiences on mobile, demoing a quick prototype of a Draw Something-like app. They use a similar approach as React Native, providing access to native APIs via a bridge. This was demonstrated when Abhishek used the device&#x27;s camera to snap a photo of the audience and then drew a hat on someone&#x27;s head.</p><h2>Designing APIs for React Native at Netflix</h2><p>Up next, the first featured talk of the evening. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clarler\">Clarence Leung</a>, Senior Software Engineer at Netflix, presented his talk on Designing APIs for React Native. First he noted the two main types of libraries one may work on: components such as tab bars and date pickers, and libraries that provide access to native services such as the camera roll or in-app payments. There are two ways one may approach when building a library for use in React Native:</p><ul><li>Provide platform-specific components</li><li>A cross-platform library with a similar API for both Android and iOS</li></ul><p>Each approach has its own considerations, and it\u2019s up to you to determine what works best for your needs.</p><p><strong>Approach #1</strong></p><p>As an example of platform-specific components, Clarence talked about the DatePickerIOS and DatePickerAndroid from core React Native. On iOS, date pickers are rendered as part of the UI and can be easily embedded in an existing view, while date pickers on Android are presented modally. It makes sense to provide separate components in this case.</p><p><strong>Approach #2</strong></p><p>Photo pickers, on the other hand, are treated similarly on Android and iOS. There are some slight differences \u2014 Android does not group photos into folders like iOS does with Selfies, for example \u2014 but those are easily handled using <code>if</code> statements and the <code>Platform</code> component.</p><p>Regardless of which approach you settle on, it\u2019s a good idea to minimize the API surface and build app-specific libraries. For example, iOS\u2019s In-App Purchase framework supports one-time, consumable purchases, as well as renewable subscriptions. If your app will only need to support consumable purchases, you may get away with dropping support for subscriptions in your cross-platform library.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/rnmsf-august-2016-netflix.jpg\"/></p><p>There was a brief Q&A session at the end of Clarence\u2019s talk. One of the interesting tid bits that came out of it was that around 80% of the React Native code written for these libraries at Netflix is shared across both Android and iOS.</p><h2>Bridging the Gap, Using React Native in Existing Codebases</h2><p>The final talk of the night was by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intelligibabble\">Leland Richardson</a> from Airbnb. The talk was focused on the use of React Native in existing codebases. I already know how easy it is to write a new app from scratch using React Native, so I was very interested to hear about Airbnb\u2019s experience adopting React Native in their existing native apps.</p><p>Leland started off by talking about greenfield apps versus brownfield apps. Greenfield means to start a project without the need to consider any prior work. This is in contrast to brownfield projects where you need to take into account the existing project\u2019s requirements, development processes, and all of the teams various needs.</p><p>When you\u2019re working on a greenfield app, the React Native CLI sets up a single repository for both Android and iOS and everything just works. The first challenge against using React Native at Airbnb was the fact that the Android and iOS app each had their own repository. Multi-repo companies have some hurdles to get past before they can adopt React Native.</p><p>To get around this, Airbnb first set up a new repo for the React Native codebase. They used their continuous integration servers to mirror the Android and iOS repos into this new repo. After tests are run and the bundle is built, the build artifacts are synced back to the Android and iOS repos. This allows the mobile engineers to work on native code without altering their development environment. Mobile engineers don&#x27;t need to install npm, run the packager, or remember to build the JavaScript bundle. The engineers writing actual React Native code do not have to worry about syncing their code across Android and iOS, as they work on the React Native repository directly.</p><p>This does come with some drawbacks, mainly they could not ship atomic updates. Changes that require a combination of native and JavaScript code would require three separate pull requests, all of which had to be carefully landed. In order to avoid conflicts, CI will fail to land changes back to the Android and iOS repos if master has changed since the build started. This would cause long delays during high commit frequency days (such as when new releases are cut).</p><p>Airbnb has since moved to a mono repo approach. Fortunately this was already under consideration, and once the Android and iOS teams became comfortable with using React Native they were happy to accelerate the move towards the mono repo.</p><p>This has solved most of the issues they had with the split repo approach. Leland did note that this does cause a higher strain on the version control servers, which may be an issue for smaller companies.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/rnmsf-august-2016-airbnb.jpg\"/></p><h3>The Navigation Problem</h3><p>The second half of Leland&#x27;s talk focused on a topic that is dear to me: the Navigation problem in React Native. He talked about the abundance of navigation libraries in React Native, both first party and third party. NavigationExperimental was mentioned as something that seemed promising, but ended up not being well suited for their use case.</p><p>In fact, none of the existing navigation libraries seem to work well for brownfield apps. A brownfield app requires that the navigation state be fully owned by the native app. For example, if a user\u2019s session expires while a React Native view is being presented, the native app should be able to take over and present a login screen as needed.</p><p>Airbnb also wanted to avoid replacing native navigation bars with JavaScript versions as part of a transition, as the effect could be jarring. Initially they limited themselves to modally presented views, but this obviously presented a problem when it came to adopting React Native more widely within their apps.</p><p>They decided that they needed their own library. The library is called <code>airbnb-navigation</code>. The library has not yet being open sourced as it is strongly tied to Airbnb\u2019s codebase, but it is something they\u2019d like to release by the end of the year.</p><p>I won\u2019t go into much detail into the library\u2019s API, but here are some of the key takeaways:</p><ul><li>One must preregister scenes ahead of time</li><li>Each scene is displayed within its own <code>RCTRootView</code>. They are presented natively on each platform (e.g. <code>UINavigationController</code>s are used on iOS).</li><li>The main <code>ScrollView</code> in a scene should be wrapped in a <code>ScrollScene</code> component. Doing so allows you to take advantage of native behaviors such as tapping on the status bar to scroll to the top on iOS.</li><li>Transitions between scenes are handled natively, no need to worry about performance.</li><li>The Android back button is automatically supported.</li><li>They can take advantage of View Controller based navigation bar styling via a Navigator.Config UI-less component.</li></ul><p>There\u2019s also some considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>The navigation bar is not easily customized in JavaScript, as it is a native component. This is intentional, as using native navigation bars is a hard requirement for this type of library.</li><li>ScreenProps must be serialized/de-serialized whenever they&#x27;re sent through the bridge, so care must be taken if sending too much data here.</li><li>Navigation state is owned by the native app (also a hard requirement for the library), so things like Redux cannot manipulate navigation state.</li></ul><p>Leland&#x27;s talk was also followed by a Q&A session. Overall, Airbnb is satisfied with React Native. They\u2019re interested in using Code Push to fix any issues without going through the App Store, and their engineers love Live Reload, as they don&#x27;t have to wait for the native app to be rebuilt after every minor change.</p><h2>Closing Remarks</h2><p>The event ended with some additional React Native news:</p><ul><li>Deco announced their <a href=\"https://www.decosoftware.com/showcase\">React Native Showcase</a>, and invited everyone to add their app to the list.</li><li>The recent <a href=\"/blog/2016/07/06/toward-better-documentation\">documentation overhaul</a> got a shoutout!</li><li>Devin Abbott, one of the creators of Deco IDE, will be teaching an introductory <a href=\"https://www.decosoftware.com/course\">React Native course</a>.</li></ul><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/rnmsf-august-2016-docs.jpg\"/></p><p>Meetups provide a good opportunity to meet and learn from other developers in the community. I&#x27;m looking forward to attending more React Native meetups in the future. If you make it up to one of these, please look out for me and let me know how we can make React Native work better for you!</p> "

A lot goes into creating good docs - the ideal documentation is concise, helpful, accurate, complete, and delightful. Recently we&#x27;ve been working hard to make the docs better based on your feedback, and we wanted to share some of the improvements we&#x27;ve made.</p><h2>Inline Examples</h2><p>When you learn a new library, a new programming language, or a new framework, there&#x27;s a beautiful moment when you first write a bit of code, try it out, see if it works... and it <em>does</em> work. You created something real. We wanted to put that visceral experience right into our docs. Like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-ReactNativeWebPlayer\">import React, { Component } from &#x27;react&#x27;; import { AppRegistry, Text, View } from &#x27;react-native&#x27;; class ScratchPad extends Component { render() { return ( <View style={{flex: 1}}> <Text style={{fontSize: 30, flex: 1, textAlign: &#x27;center&#x27;}}> Isn&#x27;t this cool? </Text> <Text style={{fontSize: 100, flex: 1, textAlign: &#x27;center&#x27;}}> ð </Text> </View> ); } } AppRegistry.registerComponent(&#x27;ScratchPad&#x27;, () => ScratchPad); </code></pre><p>We think these inline examples, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/dabbott/react-native-web-player\"><code>react-native-web-player</code></a> module with help from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devinaabbott\">Devin Abbott</a>, are a great way to learn the basics of React Native, and we have updated our <a href=\"/docs/tutorial\">tutorial for new React Native developers</a> to use these wherever possible. Check it out - if you have ever been curious to see what would happen if you modified just one little bit of sample code, this is a really nice way to poke around. Also, if you&#x27;re building developer tools and you want to show a live React Native sample on your own site, <a href=\"https://github.com/dabbott/react-native-web-player\"><code>react-native-web-player</code></a> can make that straightforward.</p><p>The core simulation engine is provided by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/necolas\">Nicolas Gallagher</a>&#x27;s <a href=\"https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web\"><code>react-native-web</code></a> project, which provides a way to display React Native components like <code>Text</code> and <code>View</code> on the web. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web\"><code>react-native-web</code></a> if you&#x27;re interested in building mobile and web experiences that share a large chunk of the codebase.</p><h2>Better Guides</h2><p>In some parts of React Native, there are multiple ways to do things, and we&#x27;ve heard feedback that we could provide better guidance.</p><p>We have a new <a href=\"/docs/navigation\">guide to Navigation</a> that compares the different approaches and advises on what you should use - <code>Navigator</code>, <code>NavigatorIOS</code>, <code>NavigationExperimental</code>. In the medium term, we&#x27;re working towards improving and consolidating those interfaces. In the short term, we hope that a better guide will make your life easier.</p><p>We also have a new <a href=\"/docs/handling-touches\">guide to handling touches</a> that explains some of the basics of making button-like interfaces, and a brief summary of the different ways to handle touch events.</p><p>Another area we worked on is Flexbox. This includes tutorials on how to <a href=\"/docs/flexbox\">handle layout with Flexbox</a> and how to control <a href=\"/docs/height-and-width\">the size of components</a>. It also includes an unsexy but hopefully-useful <a href=\"/docs/layout-props\">list of all the props that control layout in React Native</a>.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>When you start getting a React Native development environment set up on your machine, you do have to do a bunch of installing and configuring things. It&#x27;s hard to make installation a really fun and exciting experience, but we can at least make it as quick and painless as possible.</p><p>We built a <a href=\"/docs/next/getting-started\">new Getting Started workflow</a> that lets you select your development operating system and your mobile operating system up front, to provide one concise place with all the setup instructions. We also went through the installation process to make sure everything worked and to make sure that every decision point had a clear recommendation. After testing it out on our innocent coworkers, we&#x27;re pretty sure this is an improvement.</p><p>We also worked on the <a href=\"/docs/integration-with-existing-apps\">guide to integrating React Native into an existing app</a>. Many of the largest apps that use React Native, like the Facebook app itself, actually build part of the app in React Native, and part of it using regular development tools. We hope this guide makes it easier for more people to build apps this way.</p><h2>We Need Your Help</h2><p>Your feedback lets us know what we should prioritize. I know some people will read this blog post and think \"Better docs? Pffft. The documentation for X is still garbage!\". That&#x27;s great - we need that energy. The best way to give us feedback depends on the sort of feedback.</p><p>If you find a mistake in the documentation, like inaccurate descriptions or code that doesn&#x27;t actually work, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues\">file an issue</a>. Tag it with \"Documentation\", so that it&#x27;s easier to route it to the right people.</p><p>If there isn&#x27;t a specific mistake, but something in the documentation is fundamentally confusing, it&#x27;s not a great fit for a GitHub issue. Instead, post on <a href=\"https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests\">Canny</a> about the area of the docs that could use help. This helps us prioritize when we are doing more general work like guide-writing.</p><p>Thanks for reading this far, and thanks for using React Native!</p> "

In emerging markets, where <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/952628711437136/classes-performance-and-network-segmentation-on-android/\">2011 class phones</a> on <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/10/news-feed-fyi-building-for-all-connectivity/\">2G networks</a> are the majority, a focus on performance can make the difference between an app that is usable and one that isn&#x27;t.</p><p>Since releasing React Native on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/03/26/introducing-react-native.html\">iOS</a> and on <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/1189117404435352/react-native-for-android-how-we-built-the-first-cross-platform-react-native-app/\">Android</a>, we have been improving list view scrolling performance, memory efficiency, UI responsiveness, and app startup time. Startup sets the first impression of an app and stresses all parts of the framework, so it is the most rewarding and challenging problem to tackle.</p><footer><a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/895897210527114/dive-into-react-native-performance/\" class=\"btn\">Read more</a></footer><blockquote><p>This is an excerpt.

Our goal is to get this feedback loop to be under 1 second, even as your app grows.</p><p>We got close to this ideal via th ",
            "#cdata-section3": " ree main features:</p><ul><li>Use JavaScript as the language doesn&#x27;t have a long compilation cycle time.</li><li>Implement a tool called Packager that transforms es6/flow/jsx files into normal JavaScript that the VM can understand. It was designed as a server that keeps intermediate state in memory to enable fast incremental changes and uses multiple cores.</li><li>Build a feature called Live Reload that reloads the app on save.</li></ul><p>At this point, the bottleneck for developers is no longer the time it takes to reload the app but losing the state of your app. A common scenario is to work on a feature that is multiple screens away from the launch screen. Every time you reload, you&#x27;ve got to click on the same path again and again to get back to your feature, making the cycle multiple-seconds long.</p><h2>Hot Reloading</h2><p>The idea behind hot reloading is to keep the app running and to inject new versions of the files that you edited at runtime. This way, you don&#x27;t lose any of your state which is especially useful if you are tweaking the UI.</p><p>A video is worth a thousand words. Check out the difference between Live Reload (current) and Hot Reload (new).</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2uQzVi-KFuc\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>If you look closely, you can notice that it is possible to recover from a red box and you can also start importing modules that were not previously there without having to do a full reload.</p><p><strong>Word of warning:</strong> because JavaScript is a very stateful language, hot reloading cannot be perfectly implemented. In practice, we found out that the current setup is working well for a large amount of usual use cases and a full reload is always available in case something gets messed up.</p><p>Hot reloading is available as of 0.22, you can enable it:</p><ul><li>Open the developer menu</li><li>Tap on \"Enable Hot Reloading\"</li></ul><h2>Implementation in a nutshell</h2><p>Now that we&#x27;ve seen why we want it and how to use it, the fun part begins: how it actually works.</p><p>Hot Reloading is built on top of a feature <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/\">Hot Module Replacement</a>, or HMR. It was first introduced by Webpack and we implemented it inside of React Native Packager. HMR makes the Packager watch for file changes and send HMR updates to a thin HMR runtime included on the app.</p><p>In a nutshell, the HMR update contains the new code of the JS modules that changed. When the runtime receives them, it replaces the old modules&#x27; code with the new one:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/hmr-architecture.png\"/></p><p>The HMR update contains a bit more than just the module&#x27;s code we want to change because replacing it, it&#x27;s not enough for the runtime to pick up the changes. The problem is that the module system may have already cached the <em>exports</em> of the module we want to update. For instance, say you have an app composed of these two modules:</p><pre><code>// log.js function log(message) { const time = require(&#x27;./time&#x27;); console.log(`[${time()}] ${message}`); } module.exports = log; </code></pre><pre><code>// time.js function time() { return new Date().getTime(); } module.exports = time; </code></pre><p>The module <code>log</code>, prints out the provided message including the current date provided by the module <code>time</code>.</p><p>When the app is bundled, React Native registers each module on the module system using the <code>__d</code> function. For this app, among many <code>__d</code> definitions, there will one for <code>log</code>:</p><pre><code>__d(&#x27;log&#x27;, function() { ... // module&#x27;s code }); </code></pre><p>This invocation wraps each module&#x27;s code into an anonymous function which we generally refer to as the factory function. The module system runtime keeps track of each module&#x27;s factory function, whether it has already been executed, and the result of such execution (exports). When a module is required, the module system either provides the already cached exports or executes the module&#x27;s factory function for the first time and saves the result.</p><p>So say you start your app and require <code>log</code>. At this point, neither <code>log</code> nor <code>time</code>&#x27;s factory functions have been executed so no exports have been cached. Then, the user modifies <code>time</code> to return the date in <code>MM/DD</code>:</p><pre><code>// time.js function bar() { var date = new Date(); return `${date.getMonth() + 1}/${date.getDate()}`; } module.exports = bar; </code></pre><p>The Packager will send time&#x27;s new code to the runtime (step 1), and when <code>log</code> gets eventually required the exported function gets executed it will do so with <code>time</code>&#x27;s changes (step 2):</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/hmr-step.png\"/></p><p>Now say the code of <code>log</code> requires <code>time</code> as a top level require:</p><pre><code>const time = require(&#x27;./time&#x27;); // top level require // log.js function log(message) { console.log(`[${time()}] ${message}`); } module.exports = log; </code></pre><p>When <code>log</code> is required, the runtime will cache its exports and <code>time</code>&#x27;s one. (step 1). Then, when <code>time</code> is modified, the HMR process cannot simply finish after replacing <code>time</code>&#x27;s code. If it did, when <code>log</code> gets executed, it would do so with a cached copy of <code>time</code> (old code).</p><p>For <code>log</code> to pick up <code>time</code> changes, we&#x27;ll need to clear its cached exports because one of the modules it depends on was hot swapped (step 3). Finally, when <code>log</code> gets required again, its factory function will get executed requiring <code>time</code> and getting its new code.</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/hmr-log.png\"/></p><h2>HMR API</h2><p>HMR in React Native extends the module system by introducing the <code>hot</code> object. This API is based on <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/hot-module-replacement.md\">Webpack</a>&#x27;s one. The <code>hot</code> object exposes a function called <code>accept</code> which allows you to define a callback that will be executed when the module needs to be hot swapped. For instance, if we would change <code>time</code>&#x27;s code as follows, every time we save time, we&#x27;ll see \u201Ctime changed\u201D in the console:</p><pre><code>// time.js function time() { ... // new code } module.hot.accept(() => { console.log(&#x27;time changed&#x27;); }); module.exports = time; </code></pre><p>Note that only in rare cases you would need to use this API manually. Hot Reloading should work out of the box for the most common use cases.</p><h2>HMR Runtime</h2><p>As we&#x27;ve seen before, sometimes it&#x27;s not enough only accepting the HMR update because a module that uses the one being hot swapped may have been already executed and its imports cached. For instance, suppose the dependency tree for the movies app example had a top-level <code>MovieRouter</code> that depended on the <code>MovieSearch</code> and <code>MovieScreen</code> views, which depended on the <code>log</code> and <code>time</code> modules from the previous examples:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/hmr-diamond.png\"/></p><p>If the user accesses the movies&#x27; search view but not the other one, all the modules except for <code>MovieScreen</code> would have cached exports. If a change is made to module <code>time</code>, the runtime will have to clear the exports of <code>log</code> for it to pick up <code>time</code>&#x27;s changes. The process wouldn&#x27;t finish there: the runtime will repeat this process recursively up until all the parents have been accepted. So, it&#x27;ll grab the modules that depend on <code>log</code> and try to accept them. For <code>MovieScreen</code> it can bail, as it hasn&#x27;t been required yet. For <code>MovieSearch</code>, it will have to clear its exports and process its parents recursively. Finally, it will do the same thing for <code>MovieRouter</code> and finish there as no modules depends on it.</p><p>In order to walk the dependency tree, the runtime receives the inverse dependency tree from the Packager on the HMR update. For this example the runtime will receive a JSON object like this one:</p><pre><code>{ modules: [ { name: &#x27;time&#x27;, code: /* time&#x27;s new code */ } ], inverseDependencies: { MovieRouter: [], MovieScreen: [&#x27;MovieRouter&#x27;], MovieSearch: [&#x27;MovieRouter&#x27;], log: [&#x27;MovieScreen&#x27;, &#x27;MovieSearch&#x27;], time: [&#x27;log&#x27;], } } </code></pre><h2>React Components</h2><p>React components are a bit harder to get to work with Hot Reloading. The problem is that we can&#x27;t simply replace the old code with the new one as we&#x27;d loose the component&#x27;s state. For React web applications, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a> implemented a babel <a href=\"http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/\">transform</a> that uses Webpack&#x27;s HMR API to solve this issue. In a nutshell, his solution works by creating a proxy for every single React component on <em>transform time</em>. The proxies hold the component&#x27;s state and delegate the lifecycle methods to the actual components, which are the ones we hot reload:</p><p><img src=\"/blog/assets/hmr-proxy.png\"/></p><p>Besides creating the proxy component, the transform also defines the <code>accept</code> function with a piece of code to force React to re-render the component. This way, we can hot reload rendering code without losing any of the app&#x27;s state.</p><p>The default <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packager/transformer.js#L92-L95\">transformer</a> that comes with React Native uses the <code>babel-preset-react-native</code>, which is <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/babel-preset/configs/hmr.js#L24-L31\">configured</a> to use <code>react-transform</code> the same way you&#x27;d use it on a React web project that uses Webpack.</p><h2>Redux Stores</h2><p>To enable Hot Reloading on <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/\">Redux</a> stores you will just need to use the HMR API similarly to what you&#x27;d do on a web project that uses Webpack:</p><pre><code>// configureStore.js import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from &#x27;redux&#x27;; import thunk from &#x27;redux-thunk&#x27;; import reducer from &#x27;../reducers&#x27;; export default function configureStore(initialState) { const store = createStore( reducer, initialState, applyMiddleware(thunk), ); if (module.hot) { module.hot.accept(() => { const nextRootReducer = require(&#x27;../reducers/index&#x27;).default; store.replaceReducer(nextRootReducer); }); } return store; }; </code></pre><p>When you change a reducer, the code to accept that reducer will be sent to the client. Then the client will realize that the reducer doesn&#x27;t know how to accept itself, so it will look for all the modules that refer it and try to accept them. Eventually, the flow will get to the single store, the <code>configureStore</code> module, which will accept the HMR update.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you are interested in helping making hot reloading better, I encourage you to read <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/hot-reloading-in-react-1140438583bf#.jmivpvmz4\">Dan Abramov&#x27;s post around the future of hot reloading</a> and to contribute. For example, Johny Days is going to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/6179\">make it work with multiple connected clients</a>. We&#x27;re relying on you all to maintain and improve this feature.</p><p>With React Native, we have the opportunity to rethink the way we build apps in order to make it a great developer experience. Hot reloading is only one piece of the puzzle, what other crazy hacks can we do to make it better?</p> "

It wasn&#x27;t until we&#x27;d been building with React for a while, though, that we started to understand what makes it so powerful.</p><p>React forces us to break our applications down into discrete components, each representing a single view. These components make it easier to iterate on our products, since we don&#x27;t need to keep the entire system in our head in order to make changes to one part of it. More important, though, React wraps the DOM&#x27;s mutative, imperative API with a declarative one, which raises the level of abstraction and simplifies the programming model. What we&#x27;ve found is that when we build with React, our code is a lot more predictable. This predictability makes it so we can iterate more quickly with confidence, and our applications are a lot more reliable as a result. Additionally, it&#x27;s not only easier to scale our applications when they&#x27;re built with React, but we&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s also easier to scale the size of our teams themselves.</p><p>Together with the rapid iteration cycle of the web, we&#x27;ve been able to build some awesome products with React, including many components of Facebook.com. Additionally, we&#x27;ve built amazing frameworks in JavaScript on top of React, like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html\">Relay</a>, which allows us to greatly simplify our data fetching at scale. Of course, web is only part of the story. Facebook also has widely used Android and iOS apps, which are built on top of disjointed, proprietary technology stacks. Having to build our apps on top of multiple platforms has bifurcated our engineering organization, but that&#x27;s only one of the things that makes native mobile application development hard.</p><footer><a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/1014532261909640/react-native-bringing-modern-web-techniques-to-mobile/\" class=\"btn\">Read more</a></footer><blockquote><p>This is an excerpt.
